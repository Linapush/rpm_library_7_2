And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How

should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!



Forsooth, there is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the

stream of my love beareth this along with it, down—to the sea!



New paths do I tread, a new speech cometh unto me; tired have I become—

like all creators—of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on

worn-out soles.



Too slowly runneth all speaking for me:—into thy chariot, O storm, do I

leap! And even thee will I whip with my spite!



Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Happy

Isles where my friends sojourn;—



And mine enemies amongst them! How I now love every one unto whom I may

but speak! Even mine enemies pertain to my bliss.



And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then doth my spear always

help me up best: it is my foot’s ever ready servant:—



The spear which I hurl at mine enemies! How grateful am I to mine

enemies that I may at last hurl it!



Too great hath been the tension of my cloud: ‘twixt laughters of

lightnings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.



Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm

over the mountains: thus cometh its assuagement.



Verily, like a storm cometh my happiness, and my freedom! But mine

enemies shall think that THE EVIL ONE roareth over their heads.



Yea, ye also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and perhaps

ye will flee therefrom, along with mine enemies.



Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds’ flutes! Ah, that

my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we already

learned with one another!
