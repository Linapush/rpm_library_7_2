his love of Wagner’s music, and the undoubted power of the great

musician’s personality, in order to realise how very uncritical his

attitude must have been in the first flood of his enthusiasm. Again,

when the friendship ripened, we cannot well imagine Nietzsche, the

younger man, being anything less than intoxicated by his senior’s

attention and love, and we are therefore not surprised to find him

pressing Wagner forward as the great Reformer and Saviour of mankind.

“Wagner in Bayreuth” (English Edition, 1909) gives us the best proof

of Nietzsche’s infatuation, and although signs are not wanting in this

essay which show how clearly and even cruelly he was sub-consciously

“taking stock” of his friend—even then, the work is a record of what

great love and admiration can do in the way of endowing the object

of one’s affection with all the qualities and ideals that a fertile

imagination can conceive.



When the blow came it was therefore all the more severe. Nietzsche

at length realised that the friend of his fancy and the real Richard

Wagner—the composer of Parsifal—were not one; the fact dawned

upon him slowly; disappointment upon disappointment, revelation after

revelation, ultimately brought it home to him, and though his best

instincts were naturally opposed to it at first, the revulsion of

feeling at last became too strong to be ignored, and Nietzsche was

plunged into the blackest despair. Years after his break with Wagner,

he wrote “The Case of Wagner”, and “Nietzsche contra Wagner”, and these

works are with us to prove the sincerity and depth of his views on the

man who was the greatest event of his life.



The poem in this discourse is, of course, reminiscent of Wagner’s own

poetical manner, and it must be remembered that the whole was written

subsequent to Nietzsche’s final break with his friend. The dialogue

between Zarathustra and the Magician reveals pretty fully what it

was that Nietzsche grew to loathe so intensely in Wagner,—viz., his

pronounced histrionic tendencies, his dissembling powers, his inordinate

vanity, his equivocalness, his falseness. “It honoureth thee,” says

Zarathustra, “that thou soughtest for greatness, but it betrayeth thee

also. Thou art not great.” The Magician is nevertheless sent as a guest

to Zarathustra’s cave; for, in his heart, Zarathustra believed until the

end that the Magician was a higher man broken by modern values.
