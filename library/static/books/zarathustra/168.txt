THIRD PART.





“Ye look aloft when ye long for exaltation, and I look downward because

I am exalted.



“Who among you can at the same time laugh and be exalted?



“He who climbeth on the highest mountains, laugheth at all tragic plays

and tragic realities.”—ZARATHUSTRA, I., “Reading and Writing.”









XLV. THE WANDERER.





Then, when it was about midnight, Zarathustra went his way over the

ridge of the isle, that he might arrive early in the morning at the

other coast; because there he meant to embark. For there was a good

roadstead there, in which foreign ships also liked to anchor: those

ships took many people with them, who wished to cross over from the

Happy Isles. So when Zarathustra thus ascended the mountain, he thought

on the way of his many solitary wanderings from youth onwards, and how

many mountains and ridges and summits he had already climbed.



I am a wanderer and mountain-climber, said he to his heart, I love not

the plains, and it seemeth I cannot long sit still.



And whatever may still overtake me as fate and experience—a wandering

will be therein, and a mountain-climbing: in the end one experienceth

only oneself.



The time is now past when accidents could befall me; and what COULD now

fall to my lot which would not already be mine own!



It returneth only, it cometh home to me at last—mine own Self, and

such of it as hath been long abroad, and scattered among things and

accidents.
