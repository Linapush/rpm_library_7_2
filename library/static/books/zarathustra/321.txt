     Long adown the precipice look,

     Adown THEIR precipice:—

     Oh, how they whirl down now,

     Thereunder, therein,

     To ever deeper profoundness whirling!—

     Then,

     Sudden,

     With aim aright,

     With quivering flight,

     On LAMBKINS pouncing,

     Headlong down, sore-hungry,

     For lambkins longing,

     Fierce ’gainst all lamb-spirits,

     Furious-fierce ’gainst all that look

     Sheeplike, or lambeyed, or crisp-woolly,

     —Grey, with lambsheep kindliness!



     Even thus,

     Eaglelike, pantherlike,

     Are the poet’s desires,

     Are THINE OWN desires ‘neath a thousand guises,

     Thou fool!  Thou poet!

     Thou who all mankind viewedst—

     So God, as sheep—:

     The God TO REND within mankind,

     As the sheep in mankind,

     And in rending LAUGHING—



     THAT, THAT is thine own blessedness!

     Of a panther and eagle—blessedness!

     Of a poet and fool—the blessedness!—



     In evening’s limpid air,

     What time the moon’s sickle,

     Green, ‘twixt the purple-glowings,

     And jealous, steal’th forth:

     —Of day the foe,

     With every step in secret,

     The rosy garland-hammocks

     Downsickling, till they’ve sunken
