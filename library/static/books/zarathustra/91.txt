A hundred times hitherto hath spirit as well as virtue attempted and

erred. Yea, an attempt hath man been. Alas, much ignorance and error

hath become embodied in us!



Not only the rationality of millenniums—also their madness, breaketh

A thousand paths are there which have never yet been trodden; a thousand

salubrities and hidden islands of life. Unexhausted and undiscovered is

still man and man’s world.



Awake and hearken, ye lonesome ones! From the future come winds with

stealthy pinions, and to fine ears good tidings are proclaimed.



Ye lonesome ones of to-day, ye seceding ones, ye shall one day be a
