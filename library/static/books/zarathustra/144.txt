“Since I have known the body better”—said Zarathustra to one of his

disciples—“the spirit hath only been to me symbolically spirit; and all

the ‘imperishable’—that is also but a simile.”



“So have I heard thee say once before,” answered the disciple, “and then

thou addedst: ‘But the poets lie too much.’ Why didst thou say that the

poets lie too much?”



“Why?” said Zarathustra. “Thou askest why? I do not belong to those who

may be asked after their Why.



Is my experience but of yesterday? It is long ago that I experienced the

reasons for mine opinions.



Should I not have to be a cask of memory, if I also wanted to have my

reasons with me?



It is already too much for me even to retain mine opinions; and many a

bird flieth away.



And sometimes, also, do I find a fugitive creature in my dovecote, which

is alien to me, and trembleth when I lay my hand upon it.



But what did Zarathustra once say unto thee? That the poets lie too

much?—But Zarathustra also is a poet.



Believest thou that he there spake the truth? Why dost thou believe it?”



The disciple answered: “I believe in Zarathustra.” But Zarathustra shook

his head and smiled.—



Belief doth not sanctify me, said he, least of all the belief in myself.



But granting that some one did say in all seriousness that the poets lie

too much: he was right—WE do lie too much.



We also know too little, and are bad learners: so we are obliged to lie.
