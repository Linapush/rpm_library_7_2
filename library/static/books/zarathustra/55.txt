The new, would the noble man create, and a new virtue. The old, wanteth

the good man, and that the old should be conserved.



But it is not the danger of the noble man to turn a good man, but lest

he should become a blusterer, a scoffer, or a destroyer.



Ah! I have known noble ones who lost their highest hope. And then they

disparaged all high hopes.



Then lived they shamelessly in temporary pleasures, and beyond the day

had hardly an aim.



“Spirit is also voluptuousness,”—said they. Then broke the wings of

their spirit; and now it creepeth about, and defileth where it gnaweth.



Once they thought of becoming heroes; but sensualists are they now. A

trouble and a terror is the hero to them.



But by my love and hope I conjure thee: cast not away the hero in thy

soul! Maintain holy thy highest hope!—



Thus spake Zarathustra.

There are preachers of death: and the earth is full of those to whom

desistance from life must be preached.



Full is the earth of the superfluous; marred is life by the

many-too-many. May they be decoyed out of this life by the “life

eternal”!



“The yellow ones”: so are called the preachers of death, or “the black

ones.” But I will show them unto you in other colours besides.
