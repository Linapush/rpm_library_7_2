And Zarathustra stood still and meditated. At last he said sorrowfully:

“There hath EVERYTHING become smaller!



Everywhere do I see lower doorways: he who is of MY type can still go

therethrough, but—he must stoop!



Oh, when shall I arrive again at my home, where I shall no longer have

to stoop—shall no longer have to stoop BEFORE THE SMALL ONES!”—And

Zarathustra sighed, and gazed into the distance.—



The same day, however, he gave his discourse on the bedwarfing virtue.

I pass through this people and keep mine eyes open: they do not forgive

me for not envying their virtues.



They bite at me, because I say unto them that for small people, small

virtues are necessary—and because it is hard for me to understand that

small people are NECESSARY!



Here am I still like a cock in a strange farm-yard, at which even the

hens peck: but on that account I am not unfriendly to the hens.



I am courteous towards them, as towards all small annoyances; to be

prickly towards what is small, seemeth to me wisdom for hedgehogs.



They all speak of me when they sit around their fire in the

evening—they speak of me, but no one thinketh—of me!



This is the new stillness which I have experienced: their noise around

me spreadeth a mantle over my thoughts.



They shout to one another: “What is this gloomy cloud about to do to us?

Let us see that it doth not bring a plague upon us!”



And recently did a woman seize upon her child that was coming unto

me: “Take the children away,” cried she, “such eyes scorch children’s

souls.”
