—The bad game of drifting clouds, of damp melancholy, of curtained

heavens, of stolen suns, of howling autumn-winds,



—The bad game of our howling and crying for help! Abide with us, O

Zarathustra! Here there is much concealed misery that wisheth to speak,

not dance, profound, but without thoughts, like little secrets, like

beribboned riddles, like dessert-nuts—

crossed his legs, and looked calmly and sagely around him:—with his

nostrils, however, he inhaled the air slowly and questioningly, like one

who in new countries tasteth new foreign air. Afterward he began to sing
