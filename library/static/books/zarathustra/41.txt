Suffering was it, and impotence—that created all backworlds; and

the short madness of happiness, which only the greatest sufferer

experienceth.



Weariness, which seeketh to get to the ultimate with one leap, with

a death-leap; a poor ignorant weariness, unwilling even to will any

longer: that created all Gods and backworlds.



Believe me, my brethren! It was the body which despaired of the body—it

groped with the fingers of the infatuated spirit at the ultimate walls.



Believe me, my brethren! It was the body which despaired of the

earth—it heard the bowels of existence speaking unto it.



And then it sought to get through the ultimate walls with its head—and

not with its head only—into “the other world.”



But that “other world” is well concealed from man, that dehumanised,

inhuman world, which is a celestial naught; and the bowels of existence

do not speak unto man, except as man.



Verily, it is difficult to prove all being, and hard to make it speak.

Tell me, ye brethren, is not the strangest of all things best proved?



Yea, this ego, with its contradiction and perplexity, speaketh most

uprightly of its being—this creating, willing, evaluing ego, which is

the measure and value of things.



And this most upright existence, the ego—it speaketh of the body, and

still implieth the body, even when it museth and raveth and fluttereth

with broken wings.



Always more uprightly learneth it to speak, the ego; and the more it

learneth, the more doth it find titles and honours for the body and the

earth.



A new pride taught me mine ego, and that teach I unto men: no longer

to thrust one’s head into the sand of celestial things, but to carry it

freely, a terrestrial head, which giveth meaning to the earth!
