strong voice, and stroked his beard—“THAT do I know better! There are

still Happy Isles! Silence THEREON, thou sighing sorrow-sack!



Cease to splash THEREON, thou rain-cloud of the forenoon! Do I not

already stand here wet with thy misery, and drenched like a dog?



Now do I shake myself and run away from thee, that I may again become

dry: thereat mayest thou not wonder! Do I seem to thee discourteous?

Here however is MY court.



But as regards the higher man: well! I shall seek him at once in those

forests: FROM THENCE came his cry. Perhaps he is there hard beset by an

evil beast.



He is in MY domain: therein shall he receive no scath! And verily, there

are many evil beasts about me.”—



With those words Zarathustra turned around to depart. Then said the

soothsayer: “O Zarathustra, thou art a rogue!



I know it well: thou wouldst fain be rid of me! Rather wouldst thou run

into the forest and lay snares for evil beasts!



But what good-will it do thee? In the evening wilt thou have me again:

in thine own cave will I sit, patient and heavy like a block—and wait

for thee!”



“So be it!” shouted back Zarathustra, as he went away: “and what is mine

in my cave belongeth also unto thee, my guest!



Shouldst thou however find honey therein, well! just lick it up, thou

growling bear, and sweeten thy soul! For in the evening we want both to

be in good spirits;



—In good spirits and joyful, because this day hath come to an end! And

thou thyself shalt dance to my lays, as my dancing-bear.



Thou dost not believe this? Thou shakest thy head? Well! Cheer up, old

bear! But I also—am a soothsayer.”
