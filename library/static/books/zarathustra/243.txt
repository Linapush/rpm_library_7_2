I come again with this sun, with this earth, with this eagle, with this

serpent—NOT to a new life, or a better life, or a similar life:



—I come again eternally to this identical and selfsame life, in its

greatest and its smallest, to teach again the eternal return of all

things,—



—To speak again the word of the great noontide of earth and man, to

announce again to man the Superman.



I have spoken my word. I break down by my word: so willeth mine eternal

fate—as announcer do I succumb!



The hour hath now come for the down-goer to bless himself. Thus—ENDETH

Zarathustra’s down-going.’”—



When the animals had spoken these words they were silent and waited, so

that Zarathustra might say something to them: but Zarathustra did not

hear that they were silent. On the contrary, he lay quietly with closed

eyes like a person sleeping, although he did not sleep; for he communed

just then with his soul. The serpent, however, and the eagle, when they

found him silent in such wise, respected the great stillness around him,

and prudently retired.









LVIII. THE GREAT LONGING.





O my soul, I have taught thee to say “to-day” as “once on a time” and

“formerly,” and to dance thy measure over every Here and There and

Yonder.



O my soul, I delivered thee from all by-places, I brushed down from thee

dust and spiders and twilight.



O my soul, I washed the petty shame and the by-place virtue from thee,

and persuaded thee to stand naked before the eyes of the sun.
