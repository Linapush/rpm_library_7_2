than it, like an eddy of arms and legs, into the depth. The market-place

and the people were like the sea when the storm cometh on: they all flew

apart and in disorder, especially where the body was about to fall.



Zarathustra, however, remained standing, and just beside him fell the

body, badly injured and disfigured, but not yet dead. After a while

consciousness returned to the shattered man, and he saw Zarathustra
