And how could I endure to be a man, if man were not also the composer,

and riddle-reader, and redeemer of chance!



To redeem what is past, and to transform every “It was” into “Thus would

I have it!”—that only do I call redemption!



Will—so is the emancipator and joy-bringer called: thus have I taught

you, my friends! But now learn this likewise: the Will itself is still a

prisoner.



Willing emancipateth: but what is that called which still putteth the

emancipator in chains?



“It was”: thus is the Will’s teeth-gnashing and lonesomest tribulation

called. Impotent towards what hath been done—it is a malicious

spectator of all that is past.



Not backward can the Will will; that it cannot break time and time’s

desire—that is the Will’s lonesomest tribulation.



Willing emancipateth: what doth Willing itself devise in order to get

free from its tribulation and mock at its prison?



Ah, a fool becometh every prisoner! Foolishly delivereth itself also the

imprisoned Will.



That time doth not run backward—that is its animosity: “That which

was”: so is the stone which it cannot roll called.



And thus doth it roll stones out of animosity and ill-humour, and taketh

revenge on whatever doth not, like it, feel rage and ill-humour.



Thus did the Will, the emancipator, become a torturer; and on all

that is capable of suffering it taketh revenge, because it cannot go

backward.



This, yea, this alone is REVENGE itself: the Will’s antipathy to time,

and its “It was.”



Verily, a great folly dwelleth in our Will; and it became a curse unto
