“To the clean are all things clean”—thus say the people. I, however,

say unto you: To the swine all things become swinish!



Therefore preach the visionaries and bowed-heads (whose hearts are also

bowed down): “The world itself is a filthy monster.”



For these are all unclean spirits; especially those, however, who have

no peace or rest, unless they see the world FROM THE BACKSIDE—the

backworldsmen!



TO THOSE do I say it to the face, although it sound unpleasantly: the

world resembleth man, in that it hath a backside,—SO MUCH is true!



There is in the world much filth: SO MUCH is true! But the world itself

is not therefore a filthy monster!



There is wisdom in the fact that much in the world smelleth badly:

loathing itself createth wings, and fountain-divining powers!



In the best there is still something to loathe; and the best is still

something that must be surpassed!—



O my brethren, there is much wisdom in the fact that much filth is in

the world!—



15.



Such sayings did I hear pious backworldsmen speak to their consciences,

and verily without wickedness or guile,—although there is nothing more

guileful in the world, or more wicked.



“Let the world be as it is! Raise not a finger against it!”



“Let whoever will choke and stab and skin and scrape the people: raise

not a finger against it! Thereby will they learn to renounce the world.”



“And thine own reason—this shalt thou thyself stifle and choke; for it

is a reason of this world,—thereby wilt thou learn thyself to renounce

the world.”—
