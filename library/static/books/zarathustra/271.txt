When however Zarathustra had gone round a rock, then saw he on the same

path, not far below him, a man who threw his limbs about like a maniac,

and at last tumbled to the ground on his belly. “Halt!” said then

Zarathustra to his heart, “he there must surely be the higher man, from

him came that dreadful cry of distress,—I will see if I can help him.”

 When, however, he ran to the spot where the man lay on the ground,

he found a trembling old man, with fixed eyes; and in spite of all

Zarathustra’s efforts to lift him and set him again on his feet, it was

all in vain. The unfortunate one, also, did not seem to notice that some

one was beside him; on the contrary, he continually looked around with

moving gestures, like one forsaken and isolated from all the world.

At last, however, after much trembling, and convulsion, and

curling-himself-up, he began to lament thus:



     Who warm’th me, who lov’th me still?

     Give ardent fingers!

     Give heartening charcoal-warmers!

     Prone, outstretched, trembling,

     Like him, half dead and cold, whose feet one warm’th—

     And shaken, ah! by unfamiliar fevers,

     Shivering with sharpened, icy-cold frost-arrows,

     By thee pursued, my fancy!

     Ineffable!  Recondite!  Sore-frightening!

     Thou huntsman ’hind the cloud-banks!

     Now lightning-struck by thee,

     Thou mocking eye that me in darkness watcheth:

     —Thus do I lie,

     Bend myself, twist myself, convulsed

     With all eternal torture,

     And smitten

     By thee, cruellest huntsman,

     Thou unfamiliar—GOD...



     Smite deeper!

     Smite yet once more!

     Pierce through and rend my heart!

     What mean’th this torture
