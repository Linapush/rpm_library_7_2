Devise me, then, the justice which acquitteth every one except the

judge!



And would ye hear this likewise? To him who seeketh to be just from the

heart, even the lie becometh philanthropy.



But how could I be just from the heart! How can I give every one his

own! Let this be enough for me: I give unto every one mine own.



Finally, my brethren, guard against doing wrong to any anchorite. How

could an anchorite forget! How could he requite!



Like a deep well is an anchorite. Easy is it to throw in a stone: if

it should sink to the bottom, however, tell me, who will bring it out

again?



Guard against injuring the anchorite! If ye have done so, however, well

then, kill him also!â€”



Thus spake Zarathustra.









XX. CHILD AND MARRIAGE.





I have a question for thee alone, my brother: like a sounding-lead, cast

I this question into thy soul, that I may know its depth.



Thou art young, and desirest child and marriage. But I ask thee: Art

thou a man ENTITLED to desire a child?



Art thou the victorious one, the self-conqueror, the ruler of thy

passions, the master of thy virtues? Thus do I ask thee.



Or doth the animal speak in thy wish, and necessity? Or isolation? Or

discord in thee?
