O my soul, there is nowhere a soul which could be more loving and more

comprehensive and more extensive! Where could future and past be closer

together than with thee?



O my soul, I have given thee everything, and all my hands have become

empty by thee:—and now! Now sayest thou to me, smiling and full of

melancholy: “Which of us oweth thanks?—



—Doth the giver not owe thanks because the receiver received? Is

bestowing not a necessity? Is receiving not—pitying?”—



O my soul, I understand the smiling of thy melancholy: thine

over-abundance itself now stretcheth out longing hands!



Thy fulness looketh forth over raging seas, and seeketh and waiteth: the

longing of over-fulness looketh forth from the smiling heaven of thine

eyes!



And verily, O my soul! Who could see thy smiling and not melt

into tears? The angels themselves melt into tears through the

over-graciousness of thy smiling.



Thy graciousness and over-graciousness, is it which will not complain

and weep: and yet, O my soul, longeth thy smiling for tears, and thy

trembling mouth for sobs.



“Is not all weeping complaining? And all complaining, accusing?” Thus

speakest thou to thyself; and therefore, O my soul, wilt thou rather

smile than pour forth thy grief—



—Than in gushing tears pour forth all thy grief concerning thy

fulness, and concerning the craving of the vine for the vintager and

vintage-knife!



But wilt thou not weep, wilt thou not weep forth thy purple melancholy,

then wilt thou have to SING, O my soul!—Behold, I smile myself, who

foretell thee this:



—Thou wilt have to sing with passionate song, until all seas turn calm
