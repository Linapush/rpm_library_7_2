above all, is peace and the cessation of pain. But neither great races

nor great castes have ever been built up in this way. “Who still wanteth

to rule?” Zarathustra asks in the “Prologue”. “Who still wanteth to

obey? Both are too burdensome.” This is rapidly becoming everybody’s

attitude to-day. The tame moral reading of the face of nature, together

with such democratic interpretations of life as those suggested by

Herbert Spencer, are signs of a physiological condition which is the

reverse of that bounding and irresponsible healthiness in which harder

and more tragic values rule.

This should be read in conjunction with “Child and Marriage”. In the

fifth verse we shall recognise our old friend “Marriage on the ten-years

system,” which George Meredith suggested some years ago. This, however,

must not be taken too literally. I do not think Nietzsche’s profoundest

views on marriage were ever intended to be given over to the public at

all, at least not for the present. They appear in the biography by his

sister, and although their wisdom is unquestionable, the nature of the

reforms he suggests render it impossible for them to become popular just

now.

Par. 28.



Nietzsche was not an iconoclast from predilection. No bitterness or

empty hate dictated his vituperations against existing values and

against the dogmas of his parents and forefathers. He knew too well what

these things meant to the millions who profess them, to approach the

task of uprooting them with levity or even with haste. He saw what

modern anarchists and revolutionists do NOT see—namely, that man is in

danger of actual destruction when his customs and values are broken.

I need hardly point out, therefore, how deeply he was conscious of

the responsibility he threw upon our shoulders when he invited us to

reconsider our position. The lines in this paragraph are evidence enough

of his earnestness.
