Lift up your hearts, my brethren, high, higher! And do not forget your

legs! Lift up also your legs, ye good dancers, and better still, if ye

stand upon your heads!

This crown of the laughter, this rose-garland crown: I myself have put

on this crown, I myself have consecrated my laughter. No one else have I

found to-day potent enough for this.



Zarathustra the dancer, Zarathustra the light one, who beckoneth with

his pinions, one ready for flight, beckoning unto all birds, ready and

prepared, a blissfully light-spirited one:—



Zarathustra the soothsayer, Zarathustra the sooth-laugher, no impatient

one, no absolute one, one who loveth leaps and side-leaps; I myself have

put on this crown!

Lift up your hearts, my brethren, high, higher! And do not forget your

legs! Lift up also your legs, ye good dancers, and better still if ye

stand upon your heads!



There are also heavy animals in a state of happiness, there are

club-footed ones from the beginning. Curiously do they exert themselves,

like an elephant which endeavoureth to stand upon its head.



Better, however, to be foolish with happiness than foolish with

misfortune, better to dance awkwardly than walk lamely. So learn, I

pray you, my wisdom, ye higher men: even the worst thing hath two good

reverse sides,—



—Even the worst thing hath good dancing-legs: so learn, I pray you, ye

higher men, to put yourselves on your proper legs!



So unlearn, I pray you, the sorrow-sighing, and all the

populace-sadness! Oh, how sad the buffoons of the populace seem to me

to-day! This to-day, however, is that of the populace.
