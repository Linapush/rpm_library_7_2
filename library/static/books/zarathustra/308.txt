hearts turn giddy? Doth the abyss here yawn for you? Doth the hell-hound

here yelp at you?



Well! Take heart! ye higher men! Now only travaileth the mountain of the

human future. God hath died: now do WE desire—the Superman to live.



3.



The most careful ask to-day: “How is man to be maintained?” Zarathustra

however asketh, as the first and only one: “How is man to be SURPASSED?”



The Superman, I have at heart; THAT is the first and only thing to

me—and NOT man: not the neighbour, not the poorest, not the sorriest,

not the best.—



O my brethren, what I can love in man is that he is an over-going and a

down-going. And also in you there is much that maketh me love and hope.



In that ye have despised, ye higher men, that maketh me hope. For the

great despisers are the great reverers.



In that ye have despaired, there is much to honour. For ye have not

learned to submit yourselves, ye have not learned petty policy.



For to-day have the petty people become master: they all preach

submission and humility and policy and diligence and consideration and

the long et cetera of petty virtues.



Whatever is of the effeminate type, whatever originateth from the

servile type, and especially the populace-mishmash:—THAT wisheth now to

be master of all human destiny—O disgust! Disgust! Disgust!



THAT asketh and asketh and never tireth: “How is man to maintain himself

best, longest, most pleasantly?” Thereby—are they the masters of

to-day.



These masters of to-day—surpass them, O my brethren—these petty

people: THEY are the Superman’s greatest danger!



Surpass, ye higher men, the petty virtues, the petty policy, the
