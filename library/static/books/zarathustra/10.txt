meaning more plainly or more personally than I have done already in

one of the last chapters (Aphorism 382) of the fifth book of the ‘Gaya

Scienza’.”



“We, the new, the nameless, the hard-to-understand,”—it says

there,—“we firstlings of a yet untried future—we require for a new end

also a new means, namely, a new healthiness, stronger, sharper, tougher,

bolder and merrier than all healthiness hitherto. He whose soul

longeth to experience the whole range of hitherto recognised values

and desirabilities, and to circumnavigate all the coasts of this ideal

‘Mediterranean Sea’, who, from the adventures of his most personal

experience, wants to know how it feels to be a conqueror, and discoverer

of the ideal—as likewise how it is with the artist, the saint, the

legislator, the sage, the scholar, the devotee, the prophet, and the

godly non-conformist of the old style:—requires one thing above all

questionable, the frightful, and the divine, that our curiosity as well

as our thirst for possession thereof, have got out of hand—alas! that

nothing will now any longer satisfy us!—



“How could we still be content with THE MAN OF THE PRESENT DAY

after such outlooks, and with such a craving in our conscience and

consciousness? Sad enough; but it is unavoidable that we should look

on the worthiest aims and hopes of the man of the present-day with

ill-concealed amusement, and perhaps should no longer look at them.

Another ideal runs on before us, a strange, tempting ideal full of

danger, to which we should not like to persuade any one, because we

do not so readily acknowledge any one’s RIGHT THERETO: the ideal of

a spirit who plays naively (that is to say involuntarily and from

overflowing abundance and power) with everything that has hitherto

been called holy, good, intangible, or divine; to whom the loftiest
