This counsel, however, do I counsel to kings and churches, and to all

that is weak with age or virtue—let yourselves be o’erthrown! That ye

may again come to life, and that virtue—may come to you!—”



Thus spake I before the fire-dog: then did he interrupt me sullenly, and

asked: “Church? What is that?”



“Church?” answered I, “that is a kind of state, and indeed the most

mendacious. But remain quiet, thou dissembling dog! Thou surely knowest

thine own species best!



Like thyself the state is a dissembling dog; like thee doth it like

to speak with smoke and roaring—to make believe, like thee, that it

speaketh out of the heart of things.



For it seeketh by all means to be the most important creature on earth,

the state; and people think it so.”



When I had said this, the fire-dog acted as if mad with envy. “What!”

 cried he, “the most important creature on earth? And people think it

so?” And so much vapour and terrible voices came out of his throat, that

I thought he would choke with vexation and envy.



At last he became calmer and his panting subsided; as soon, however, as

he was quiet, I said laughingly:



“Thou art angry, fire-dog: so I am in the right about thee!



And that I may also maintain the right, hear the story of another

fire-dog; he speaketh actually out of the heart of the earth.



Gold doth his breath exhale, and golden rain: so doth his heart desire.

What are ashes and smoke and hot dregs to him!



Laughter flitteth from him like a variegated cloud; adverse is he to thy

gargling and spewing and grips in the bowels!



The gold, however, and the laughter—these doth he take out of the heart

of the earth: for, that thou mayst know it,—THE HEART OF THE EARTH IS

OF GOLD.”
