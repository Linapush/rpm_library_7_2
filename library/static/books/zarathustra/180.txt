When I shall have surmounted myself therein, then will I surmount myself

also in that which is greater; and a VICTORY shall be the seal of my

perfection!—



Meanwhile do I sail along on uncertain seas; chance flattereth me,

smooth-tongued chance; forward and backward do I gaze—, still see I no

end.



As yet hath the hour of my final struggle not come to me—or doth it

come to me perhaps just now? Verily, with insidious beauty do sea and

life gaze upon me round about:



O afternoon of my life! O happiness before eventide! O haven upon high

seas! O peace in uncertainty! How I distrust all of you!



Verily, distrustful am I of your insidious beauty! Like the lover am I,

who distrusteth too sleek smiling.



As he pusheth the best-beloved before him—tender even in severity, the

jealous one—, so do I push this blissful hour before me.



Away with thee, thou blissful hour! With thee hath there come to me an

involuntary bliss! Ready for my severest pain do I here stand:—at the

wrong time hast thou come!



Away with thee, thou blissful hour! Rather harbour there—with my

children! Hasten! and bless them before eventide with MY happiness!



There, already approacheth eventide: the sun sinketh. Away—my

happiness!—



Thus spake Zarathustra. And he waited for his misfortune the whole

night; but he waited in vain. The night remained clear and calm, and

happiness itself came nigher and nigher unto him. Towards morning,

however, Zarathustra laughed to his heart, and said mockingly:

“Happiness runneth after me. That is because I do not run after women.

Happiness, however, is a woman.”
