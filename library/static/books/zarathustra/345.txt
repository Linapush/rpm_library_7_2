Pain is also a joy, curse is also a blessing, night is also a sun,—go

away! or ye will learn that a sage is also a fool.



Said ye ever Yea to one joy? O my friends, then said ye Yea also unto

ALL woe. All things are enlinked, enlaced and enamoured,—



—Wanted ye ever once to come twice; said ye ever: “Thou pleasest me,

happiness! Instant! Moment!” then wanted ye ALL to come back again!



—All anew, all eternal, all enlinked, enlaced and enamoured, Oh, then

did ye LOVE the world,—



—Ye eternal ones, ye love it eternally and for all time: and also unto

woe do ye say: Hence! Go! but come back! FOR JOYS ALL WANT—ETERNITY!

All joy wanteth the eternity of all things, it wanteth honey, it

wanteth lees, it wanteth drunken midnight, it wanteth graves, it wanteth

grave-tears’ consolation, it wanteth gilded evening-red—



—WHAT doth not joy want! it is thirstier, heartier, hungrier, more

frightful, more mysterious, than all woe: it wanteth ITSELF, it biteth

into ITSELF, the ring’s will writheth in it,—



—It wanteth love, it wanteth hate, it is over-rich, it bestoweth, it

throweth away, it beggeth for some one to take from it, it thanketh the

taker, it would fain be hated,—



—So rich is joy that it thirsteth for woe, for hell, for hate, for

shame, for the lame, for the WORLD,—for this world, Oh, ye know it

indeed!



Ye higher men, for you doth it long, this joy, this irrepressible,

blessed joy—for your woe, ye failures! For failures, longeth all

eternal joy.



For joys all want themselves, therefore do they also want grief! O

happiness, O pain! Oh break, thou heart! Ye higher men, do learn it,
