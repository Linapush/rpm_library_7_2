Ye would still create a world before which ye can bow the knee: such is

your ultimate hope and ecstasy.



The ignorant, to be sure, the people—they are like a river on which a

boat floateth along: and in the boat sit the estimates of value, solemn

and disguised.



Your will and your valuations have ye put on the river of becoming; it

betrayeth unto me an old Will to Power, what is believed by the people

as good and evil.



It was ye, ye wisest ones, who put such guests in this boat, and gave

them pomp and proud names—ye and your ruling Will!



Onward the river now carrieth your boat: it MUST carry it. A small

matter if the rough wave foameth and angrily resisteth its keel!



It is not the river that is your danger and the end of your good and

evil, ye wisest ones: but that Will itself, the Will to Power—the

unexhausted, procreating life-will.



But that ye may understand my gospel of good and evil, for that purpose

will I tell you my gospel of life, and of the nature of all living

things.



The living thing did I follow; I walked in the broadest and narrowest

paths to learn its nature.



With a hundred-faced mirror did I catch its glance when its mouth was

shut, so that its eye might speak unto me. And its eye spake unto me.



But wherever I found living things, there heard I also the language of

obedience. All living things are obeying things.



And this heard I secondly: Whatever cannot obey itself, is commanded.

Such is the nature of living things.



This, however, is the third thing which I heard—namely, that commanding

is more difficult than obeying. And not only because the commander

beareth the burden of all obeyers, and because this burden readily
