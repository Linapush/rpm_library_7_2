heart impelled me; and exiled am I from fatherlands and motherlands.



Thus do I love only my CHILDREN’S LAND, the undiscovered in the remotest

sea: for it do I bid my sails search and search.



Unto my children will I make amends for being the child of my fathers:

and unto all the future—for THIS present-day!—



Thus spake Zarathustra.









XXXVII. IMMACULATE PERCEPTION.





When yester-eve the moon arose, then did I fancy it about to bear a sun:

so broad and teeming did it lie on the horizon.



But it was a liar with its pregnancy; and sooner will I believe in the

man in the moon than in the woman.



To be sure, little of a man is he also, that timid night-reveller.

Verily, with a bad conscience doth he stalk over the roofs.



For he is covetous and jealous, the monk in the moon; covetous of the

earth, and all the joys of lovers.



Nay, I like him not, that tom-cat on the roofs! Hateful unto me are all

that slink around half-closed windows!



Piously and silently doth he stalk along on the star-carpets:—but I

like no light-treading human feet, on which not even a spur jingleth.



Every honest one’s step speaketh; the cat however, stealeth along over

the ground. Lo! cat-like doth the moon come along, and dishonestly.—



This parable speak I unto you sentimental dissemblers, unto you, the

“pure discerners!” You do _I_ call—covetous ones!
