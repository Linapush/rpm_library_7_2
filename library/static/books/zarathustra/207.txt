—As if a tree nodded unto me, a broad-branched, strong-willed tree,

curved as a recline and a foot-stool for weary travellers: thus did the

world stand on my promontory:—



—As if delicate hands carried a casket towards me—a casket open for

strong-odoured, broad-arched tree that I love!—



On what bridge goeth the now to the hereafter? By what constraint doth

the high stoop to the low? And what enjoineth even the highest still—to
