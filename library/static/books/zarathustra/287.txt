Thus spake the ugliest man. Zarathustra however got up, and prepared to

go on: for he felt frozen to the very bowels.



“Thou nondescript,” said he, “thou warnedst me against thy path. As

thanks for it I praise mine to thee. Behold, up thither is the cave of

Zarathustra.



My cave is large and deep and hath many corners; there findeth he

that is most hidden his hiding-place. And close beside it, there are

a hundred lurking-places and by-places for creeping, fluttering, and

hopping creatures.



Thou outcast, who hast cast thyself out, thou wilt not live amongst men

and men’s pity? Well then, do like me! Thus wilt thou learn also from

me; only the doer learneth.



And talk first and foremost to mine animals! The proudest animal and the

wisest animal—they might well be the right counsellors for us both!”—



Thus spake Zarathustra and went his way, more thoughtfully and slowly

even than before: for he asked himself many things, and hardly knew what

to answer.



“How poor indeed is man,” thought he in his heart, “how ugly, how

wheezy, how full of hidden shame!



They tell me that man loveth himself. Ah, how great must that self-love

be! How much contempt is opposed to it!



Even this man hath loved himself, as he hath despised himself,—a great

lover methinketh he is, and a great despiser.



No one have I yet found who more thoroughly despised himself: even THAT

is elevation. Alas, was THIS perhaps the higher man whose cry I heard?



I love the great despisers. Man is something that hath to be

surpassed.”—
