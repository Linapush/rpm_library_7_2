they mourn.



Meanwhile do I run with warm feet hither and thither on mine

olive-mount: in the sunny corner of mine olive-mount do I sing, and mock

at all pity.—



Thus sang Zarathustra.









LI. ON PASSING-BY.





Thus slowly wandering through many peoples and divers cities, did

Zarathustra return by round-about roads to his mountains and his cave.

And behold, thereby came he unawares also to the gate of the GREAT CITY.

Here, however, a foaming fool, with extended hands, sprang forward to

him and stood in his way. It was the same fool whom the people called

“the ape of Zarathustra:” for he had learned from him something of the

expression and modulation of language, and perhaps liked also to borrow

from the store of his wisdom. And the fool talked thus to Zarathustra:



O Zarathustra, here is the great city: here hast thou nothing to seek

and everything to lose.



Why wouldst thou wade through this mire? Have pity upon thy foot! Spit

rather on the gate of the city, and—turn back!



Here is the hell for anchorites’ thoughts: here are great thoughts

seethed alive and boiled small.



Here do all great sentiments decay: here may only rattle-boned

sensations rattle!



Smellest thou not already the shambles and cookshops of the spirit?

Steameth not this city with the fumes of slaughtered spirit?



Seest thou not the souls hanging like limp dirty rags?—And they make

newspapers also out of these rags!
