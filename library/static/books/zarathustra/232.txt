Your marriage-arranging: see that it be not a bad ARRANGING! Ye have

arranged too hastily: so there FOLLOWETH therefrom—marriage-breaking!



And better marriage-breaking than marriage-bending,

marriage-lying!—Thus spake a woman unto me: “Indeed, I broke the

marriage, but first did the marriage break—me!”



The badly paired found I ever the most revengeful: they make every one

suffer for it that they no longer run singly.



On that account want I the honest ones to say to one another: “We love

each other: let us SEE TO IT that we maintain our love! Or shall our

pledging be blundering?”



—“Give us a set term and a small marriage, that we may see if we are

fit for the great marriage! It is a great matter always to be twain.”



Thus do I counsel all honest ones; and what would be my love to the

Superman, and to all that is to come, if I should counsel and speak

otherwise!



Not only to propagate yourselves onwards but UPWARDS—thereto, O my

brethren, may the garden of marriage help you!

languishing: but it bringeth also to light inner powers and secrets.



The earthquake discloseth new fountains. In the earthquake of old

peoples new fountains burst forth.



And whoever calleth out: “Lo, here is a well for many thirsty ones, one

heart for many longing ones, one will for many instruments”:—around him
