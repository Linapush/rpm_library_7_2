To be sure we have harvested: but why have all our fruits become rotten

and brown? What was it fell last night from the evil moon?



In vain was all our labour, poison hath our wine become, the evil eye

hath singed yellow our fields and hearts.



Arid have we all become; and fire falling upon us, then do we turn dust

like ashes:—yea, the fire itself have we made aweary.



All our fountains have dried up, even the sea hath receded. All the

ground trieth to gape, but the depth will not swallow!



‘Alas! where is there still a sea in which one could be drowned?’ so

soundeth our plaint—across shallow swamps.



Verily, even for dying have we become too weary; now do we keep awake

and live on—in sepulchres.”



Thus did Zarathustra hear a soothsayer speak; and the foreboding touched

his heart and transformed him. Sorrowfully did he go about and wearily;

and he became like unto those of whom the soothsayer had spoken.—



Verily, said he unto his disciples, a little while, and there cometh the

long twilight. Alas, how shall I preserve my light through it!



That it may not smother in this sorrowfulness! To remoter worlds shall

it be a light, and also to remotest nights!



Thus did Zarathustra go about grieved in his heart, and for three days

he did not take any meat or drink: he had no rest, and lost his speech.

At last it came to pass that he fell into a deep sleep. His disciples,

however, sat around him in long night-watches, and waited anxiously to

see if he would awake, and speak again, and recover from his affliction.



And this is the discourse that Zarathustra spake when he awoke; his

voice, however, came unto his disciples as from afar:



Hear, I pray you, the dream that I dreamed, my friends, and help me to

divine its meaning!
