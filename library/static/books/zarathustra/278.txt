Not long, however, after Zarathustra had freed himself from the

magician, he again saw a person sitting beside the path which he

followed, namely a tall, black man, with a haggard, pale countenance:

THIS MAN grieved him exceedingly. “Alas,” said he to his heart, “there

What! Hardly have I escaped from that magician, and must another

that the old God no longer liveth, in whom all the world once believed?”



“Thou sayest it,” answered the old man sorrowfully. “And I served that

old God until his last hour.
