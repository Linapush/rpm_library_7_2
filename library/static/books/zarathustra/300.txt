not I myself allured him to me by honey-offerings and artful lure-calls

of my happiness?



But it seemeth to me that ye are badly adapted for company: ye make

one another’s hearts fretful, ye that cry for help, when ye sit here

together? There is one that must first come,



—One who will make you laugh once more, a good jovial buffoon, a

protect every one from his wild beasts. And that is the first thing

which I offer you: security!



The second thing, however, is my little finger. And when ye have THAT,

then take the whole hand also, yea, and the heart with it! Welcome here,

welcome to you, my guests!”

king on the right, however, answered him in their name.



“O Zarathustra, by the way in which thou hast given us thy hand and thy

greeting, we recognise thee as Zarathustra. Thou hast humbled thyself
