Thou wouldst wear no raiment before thy friend? It is in honour of thy

friend that thou showest thyself to him as thou art? But he wisheth thee

to the devil on that account!



He who maketh no secret of himself shocketh: so much reason have ye

to fear nakedness! Aye, if ye were Gods, ye could then be ashamed of

clothing!



Thou canst not adorn thyself fine enough for thy friend; for thou shalt

be unto him an arrow and a longing for the Superman.



Sawest thou ever thy friend asleep—to know how he looketh? What is

usually the countenance of thy friend? It is thine own countenance, in a

coarse and imperfect mirror.



Sawest thou ever thy friend asleep? Wert thou not dismayed at thy friend

looking so? O my friend, man is something that hath to be surpassed.



In divining and keeping silence shall the friend be a master: not

everything must thou wish to see. Thy dream shall disclose unto thee

what thy friend doeth when awake.



Let thy pity be a divining: to know first if thy friend wanteth pity.

Perhaps he loveth in thee the unmoved eye, and the look of eternity.



Let thy pity for thy friend be hid under a hard shell; thou shalt bite

out a tooth upon it. Thus will it have delicacy and sweetness.



Art thou pure air and solitude and bread and medicine to thy friend?

Many a one cannot loosen his own fetters, but is nevertheless his

friend’s emancipator.



Art thou a slave? Then thou canst not be a friend. Art thou a tyrant?

Then thou canst not have friends.



Far too long hath there been a slave and a tyrant concealed in woman.

On that account woman is not yet capable of friendship: she knoweth only

love.
