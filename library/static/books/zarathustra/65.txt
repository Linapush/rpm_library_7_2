But thou, profound one, thou sufferest too profoundly even from small

wounds; and ere thou hadst recovered, the same poison-worm crawled over

thy hand.



Too proud art thou to kill these sweet-tooths. But take care lest it be

thy fate to suffer all their poisonous injustice!



They buzz around thee also with their praise: obtrusiveness, is their

praise. They want to be close to thy skin and thy blood.



They flatter thee, as one flattereth a God or devil; they whimper before

thee, as before a God or devil. What doth it come to! Flatterers are

they, and whimperers, and nothing more.



Often, also, do they show themselves to thee as amiable ones. But that

hath ever been the prudence of the cowardly. Yea! the cowardly are wise!



They think much about thee with their circumscribed souls—thou art

always suspected by them! Whatever is much thought about is at last

thought suspicious.



They punish thee for all thy virtues. They pardon thee in their inmost

hearts only—for thine errors.



Because thou art gentle and of upright character, thou sayest:

“Blameless are they for their small existence.” But their circumscribed

souls think: “Blamable is all great existence.”



Even when thou art gentle towards them, they still feel themselves

despised by thee; and they repay thy beneficence with secret

maleficence.



Thy silent pride is always counter to their taste; they rejoice if once

thou be humble enough to be frivolous.



What we recognise in a man, we also irritate in him. Therefore be on

your guard against the small ones!



In thy presence they feel themselves small, and their baseness gleameth

and gloweth against thee in invisible vengeance.
