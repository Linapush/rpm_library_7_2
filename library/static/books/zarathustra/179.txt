the highest time!”



The word blew to me through the keyhole and said “Come!” The door sprang

subtlely open unto me, and said “Go!”



But I lay enchained to my love for my children: desire spread this

snare for me—the desire for love—that I should become the prey of my

children, and lose myself in them.



Desiring—that is now for me to have lost myself. I POSSESS YOU, MY

CHILDREN! In this possessing shall everything be assurance and nothing

desire.



But brooding lay the sun of my love upon me, in his own juice stewed

Zarathustra,—then did shadows and doubts fly past me.



For frost and winter I now longed: “Oh, that frost and winter would

again make me crack and crunch!” sighed I:—then arose icy mist out of

me.



My past burst its tomb, many pains buried alive woke up—: fully slept

had they merely, concealed in corpse-clothes.



So called everything unto me in signs: “It is time!” But I—heard not,

until at last mine abyss moved, and my thought bit me.



Ah, abysmal thought, which art MY thought! When shall I find strength to

hear thee burrowing, and no longer tremble?



To my very throat throbbeth my heart when I hear thee burrowing! Thy

muteness even is like to strangle me, thou abysmal mute one!



As yet have I never ventured to call thee UP; it hath been enough that

I—have carried thee about with me! As yet have I not been strong

enough for my final lion-wantonness and playfulness.



Sufficiently formidable unto me hath thy weight ever been: but one day

shall I yet find the strength and the lion’s voice which will call thee

up!
