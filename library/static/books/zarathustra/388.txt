nature” (see pages 134, 141 of Vol. I., “Thoughts out of Season”).



Pars. 10, 11.



When we approach Nietzsche’s philosophy we must be prepared to be

independent thinkers; in fact, the greatest virtue of his works is

perhaps the subtlety with which they impose the obligation upon one

of thinking alone, of scoring off one’s own bat, and of shifting

intellectually for oneself.



Par. 13.



“I am a railing alongside the torrent; whoever is able to grasp me, may

grasp me! Your crutch, however, I am not.” These two paragraphs are an

exhortation to higher men to become independent.



Par. 15.



Here Nietzsche perhaps exaggerates the importance of heredity. As,

however, the question is by no means one on which we are all agreed,

what he says is not without value.



A very important principle in Nietzsche’s philosophy is enunciated in

the first verse of this paragraph. “The higher its type, always the

seldomer doth a thing succeed” (see page 82 of “Beyond Good and Evil”).

Those who, like some political economists, talk in a business-like way

about the terrific waste of human life and energy, deliberately overlook

the fact that the waste most to be deplored usually occurs among

higher individuals. Economy was never precisely one of nature’s leading

principles. All this sentimental wailing over the larger proportion

of failures than successes in human life, does not seem to take into

account the fact that it is the rarest thing on earth for a highly

organised being to attain to the fullest development and activity of all

its functions, simply because it is so highly organised. The blind Will

to Power in nature therefore stands in urgent need of direction by man.



Pars. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.



These paragraphs deal with Nietzsche’s protest against the democratic

seriousness (Pobelernst) of modern times. “All good things laugh,” he
