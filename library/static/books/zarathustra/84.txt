This one went forth in quest of truth as a hero, and at last got for

himself a small decked-up lie: his marriage he calleth it.



That one was reserved in intercourse and chose choicely. But one time he

spoilt his company for all time: his marriage he calleth it.



Another sought a handmaid with the virtues of an angel. But all at once

he became the handmaid of a woman, and now would he need also to become

an angel.



Careful, have I found all buyers, and all of them have astute eyes. But

even the astutest of them buyeth his wife in a sack.



Many short follies—that is called love by you. And your marriage

putteth an end to many short follies, with one long stupidity.



Your love to woman, and woman’s love to man—ah, would that it were

sympathy for suffering and veiled deities! But generally two animals

alight on one another.



But even your best love is only an enraptured simile and a painful

ardour. It is a torch to light you to loftier paths.



Beyond yourselves shall ye love some day! Then LEARN first of all to

love. And on that account ye had to drink the bitter cup of your love.



Bitterness is in the cup even of the best love: thus doth it cause

longing for the Superman; thus doth it cause thirst in thee, the

creating one!



Thirst in the creating one, arrow and longing for the Superman: tell me,

my brother, is this thy will to marriage?



Holy call I such a will, and such a marriage.—



Thus spake Zarathustra.
