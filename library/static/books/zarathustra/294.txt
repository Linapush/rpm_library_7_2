With thee have I pushed into all the forbidden, all the worst and the

furthest: and if there be anything of virtue in me, it is that I have

had no fear of any prohibition.



With thee have I broken up whatever my heart revered; all

boundary-stones and statues have I o’erthrown; the most dangerous wishes

did I pursue,—verily, beyond every crime did I once go.



With thee did I unlearn the belief in words and worths and in great

names. When the devil casteth his skin, doth not his name also fall

away? It is also skin. The devil himself is perhaps—skin.



‘Nothing is true, all is permitted’: so said I to myself. Into the

coldest water did I plunge with head and heart. Ah, how oft did I stand

there naked on that account, like a red crab!



Ah, where have gone all my goodness and all my shame and all my belief

in the good! Ah, where is the lying innocence which I once possessed,

the innocence of the good and of their noble lies!



Too oft, verily, did I follow close to the heels of truth: then did it

kick me on the face. Sometimes I meant to lie, and behold! then only did

I hit—the truth.



Too much hath become clear unto me: now it doth not concern me any more.

Nothing liveth any longer that I love,—how should I still love myself?



‘To live as I incline, or not to live at all’: so do I wish; so wisheth

also the holiest. But alas! how have _I_ still—inclination?



Have _I_—still a goal? A haven towards which MY sail is set?



A good wind? Ah, he only who knoweth WHITHER he saileth, knoweth what

wind is good, and a fair wind for him.



What still remaineth to me? A heart weary and flippant; an unstable

will; fluttering wings; a broken backbone.



This seeking for MY home: O Zarathustra, dost thou know that this

seeking hath been MY home-sickening; it eateth me up.
