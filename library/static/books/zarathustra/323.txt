Thus spake the conscientious one; the old magician, however, looked

about him, enjoying his triumph, and on that account put up with the

annoyance which the conscientious one caused him. “Be still!” said he

with modest voice, “good songs want to re-echo well; after good songs

one should be long silent.



Thus do all those present, the higher men. Thou, however, hast perhaps

understood but little of my song? In thee there is little of the magic

spirit.”



“Thou praisest me,” replied the conscientious one, “in that thou

separatest me from thyself; very well! But, ye others, what do I see? Ye

still sit there, all of you, with lusting eyes—:



Ye free spirits, whither hath your freedom gone! Ye almost seem to me

to resemble those who have long looked at bad girls dancing naked: your

souls themselves dance!



In you, ye higher men, there must be more of that which the magician

calleth his evil spirit of magic and deceit:—we must indeed be

different.



And verily, we spake and thought long enough together ere Zarathustra

came home to his cave, for me not to be unaware that we ARE different.



We SEEK different things even here aloft, ye and I. For I seek more

SECURITY; on that account have I come to Zarathustra. For he is still

the most steadfast tower and will—



—To-day, when everything tottereth, when all the earth quaketh. Ye,

however, when I see what eyes ye make, it almost seemeth to me that ye

seek MORE INSECURITY,



—More horror, more danger, more earthquake. Ye long (it almost seemeth

so to me—forgive my presumption, ye higher men)—



—Ye long for the worst and dangerousest life, which frighteneth ME

most,—for the life of wild beasts, for forests, caves, steep mountains

and labyrinthine gorges.
