On the tree of the future build we our nest; eagles shall bring us lone

ones food in their beaks!



Verily, no food of which the impure could be fellow-partakers! Fire,

would they think they devoured, and burn their mouths!



Verily, no abodes do we here keep ready for the impure! An ice-cave to

their bodies would our happiness be, and to their spirits!



And as strong winds will we live above them, neighbours to the eagles,

neighbours to the snow, neighbours to the sun: thus live the strong

winds.



And like a wind will I one day blow amongst them, and with my spirit,

take the breath from their spirit: thus willeth my future.



Verily, a strong wind is Zarathustra to all low places; and this counsel

counselleth he to his enemies, and to whatever spitteth and speweth:

“Take care not to spit AGAINST the wind!”—



Thus spake Zarathustra.









XXIX. THE TARANTULAS.





Lo, this is the tarantula’s den! Wouldst thou see the tarantula itself?

Here hangeth its web: touch this, so that it may tremble.



There cometh the tarantula willingly: Welcome, tarantula! Black on thy

back is thy triangle and symbol; and I know also what is in thy soul.



Revenge is in thy soul: wherever thou bitest, there ariseth black scab;

with revenge, thy poison maketh the soul giddy!



Thus do I speak unto you in parable, ye who make the soul giddy,

ye preachers of EQUALITY! Tarantulas are ye unto me, and secretly
