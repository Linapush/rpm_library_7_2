See how these peoples themselves now do just like the traders: they pick

up the smallest advantage out of all kinds of rubbish!



They lay lures for one another, they lure things out of one

another,—that they call “good neighbourliness.” O blessed remote period

when a people said to itself: “I will be—MASTER over peoples!”



For, my brethren, the best shall rule, the best also WILLETH to rule!

And where the teaching is different, there—the best is LACKING.

If THEY had—bread for nothing, alas! for what would THEY cry! Their

maintainment—that is their true entertainment; and they shall have it

hard!



Beasts of prey, are they: in their “working”—there is even plundering,

in their “earning”—there is even overreaching! Therefore shall they

have it hard!



Better beasts of prey shall they thus become, subtler, cleverer, MORE

MAN-LIKE: for man is the best beast of prey.



All the animals hath man already robbed of their virtues: that is why of

all animals it hath been hardest for man.



Only the birds are still beyond him. And if man should yet learn to fly,

alas! TO WHAT HEIGHT—would his rapacity fly!

Thus would I have man and woman: fit for war, the one; fit for

maternity, the other; both, however, fit for dancing with head and legs.



And lost be the day to us in which a measure hath not been danced. And

false be every truth which hath not had laughter along with it!
