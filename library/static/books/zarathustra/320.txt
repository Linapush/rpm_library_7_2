     “Nay!  Merely poet!

     A brute insidious, plundering, grovelling,

     That aye must lie,

     That wittingly, wilfully, aye must lie:

     For booty lusting,

     Motley masked,

     Self-hidden, shrouded,

     Himself his booty—

     HE—of truth the wooer?

     Nay!  Mere fool!  Mere poet!

     Just motley speaking,

     From mask of fool confusedly shouting,

     Circumambling on fabricated word-bridges,

     On motley rainbow-arches,

     ‘Twixt the spurious heavenly,

     And spurious earthly,

     Round us roving, round us soaring,—

     MERE FOOL!  MERE POET!



     HE—of truth the wooer?

     Not still, stiff, smooth and cold,

     Become an image,

     A godlike statue,

     Set up in front of temples,

     As a God’s own door-guard:

     Nay! hostile to all such truthfulness-statues,

     In every desert homelier than at temples,

     With cattish wantonness,

     Through every window leaping

     Quickly into chances,

     Every wild forest a-sniffing,

     Greedily-longingly, sniffing,

     That thou, in wild forests,

     ’Mong the motley-speckled fierce creatures,

     Shouldest rove, sinful-sound and fine-coloured,

     With longing lips smacking,

     Blessedly mocking, blessedly hellish, blessedly bloodthirsty,

     Robbing, skulking, lying—roving:—



     Or unto eagles like which fixedly,
