mirror!”



But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed:

for not myself did I see therein, but a devil’s grimace and derision.



Verily, all too well do I understand the dream’s portent and monition:

my DOCTRINE is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!



Mine enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of

my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I

gave them.



Lost are my friends; the hour hath come for me to seek my lost ones!—



With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in

anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the

spirit inspireth. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon

him: for a coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.



What hath happened unto me, mine animals?—said Zarathustra. Am I not

transformed? Hath not bliss come unto me like a whirlwind?



Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still

too young—so have patience with it!



Wounded am I by my happiness: all sufferers shall be physicians unto me!



To my friends can I again go down, and also to mine enemies! Zarathustra

can again speak and bestow, and show his best love to his loved ones!



My impatient love overfloweth in streams,—down towards sunrise and

sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rusheth my

soul into the valleys.



Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long hath

solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.



Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from

high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.
