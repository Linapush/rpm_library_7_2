Sawest thou not how often they became dumb when thou approachedst them,

and how their energy left them like the smoke of an extinguishing fire?



Yea, my friend, the bad conscience art thou of thy neighbours; for they

are unworthy of thee. Therefore they hate thee, and would fain suck thy

blood.



Thy neighbours will always be poisonous flies; what is great in

thee—that itself must make them more poisonous, and always more

fly-like.



Flee, my friend, into thy solitude—and thither, where a rough strong

breeze bloweth. It is not thy lot to be a fly-flap.—



Thus spake Zarathustra.









XIII. CHASTITY.





I love the forest. It is bad to live in cities: there, there are too

many of the lustful.



Is it not better to fall into the hands of a murderer, than into the

dreams of a lustful woman?



And just look at these men: their eye saith it—they know nothing better

on earth than to lie with a woman.



Filth is at the bottom of their souls; and alas! if their filth hath

still spirit in it!



Would that ye were perfect—at least as animals! But to animals

belongeth innocence.



Do I counsel you to slay your instincts? I counsel you to innocence in

your instincts.
