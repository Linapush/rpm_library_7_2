‘Doth Zarathustra still live? It is no longer worth while to live,

everything is indifferent, everything is useless: or else—we must live

with Zarathustra!’



‘Why doth he not come who hath so long announced himself?’ thus do many

people ask; ‘hath solitude swallowed him up? Or should we perhaps go to

him?’



Now doth it come to pass that solitude itself becometh fragile and

breaketh open, like a grave that breaketh open and can no longer hold

its dead. Everywhere one seeth resurrected ones.



Now do the waves rise and rise around thy mountain, O Zarathustra. And

however high be thy height, many of them must rise up to thee: thy boat

shall not rest much longer on dry ground.



And that we despairing ones have now come into thy cave, and already no

longer despair:—it is but a prognostic and a presage that better ones

are on the way to thee,—



—For they themselves are on the way to thee, the last remnant of

God among men—that is to say, all the men of great longing, of great

loathing, of great satiety,



—All who do not want to live unless they learn again to HOPE—unless

they learn from thee, O Zarathustra, the GREAT hope!”

distance. After a little while, however, he was again at home with his

guests, looked at them with clear scrutinising eyes, and said:



“My guests, ye higher men, I will speak plain language and plainly with

you. It is not for YOU that I have waited here in these mountains.”



(“‘Plain language and plainly?’ Good God!” said here the king on the

left to himself; “one seeth he doth not know the good Occidentals, this

sage out of the Orient!
