they spake of great men—and I hold to my belief that it was a reversed

cripple, who had too little of everything, and too much of one thing.



When Zarathustra had spoken thus unto the hunchback, and unto those of

whom the hunchback was the mouthpiece and advocate, then did he turn to

his disciples in profound dejection, and said:



Verily, my friends, I walk amongst men as amongst the fragments and

limbs of human beings!



This is the terrible thing to mine eye, that I find man broken up, and

scattered about, as on a battle- and butcher-ground.



And when mine eye fleeth from the present to the bygone, it findeth ever

the same: fragments and limbs and fearful chances—but no men!



The present and the bygone upon earth—ah! my friends—that is MY most

unbearable trouble; and I should not know how to live, if I were not a

seer of what is to come.



A seer, a purposer, a creator, a future itself, and a bridge to the

future—and alas! also as it were a cripple on this bridge: all that is

Zarathustra.



And ye also asked yourselves often: “Who is Zarathustra to us? What

shall he be called by us?” And like me, did ye give yourselves questions

for answers.



Is he a promiser? Or a fulfiller? A conqueror? Or an inheritor? A

harvest? Or a ploughshare? A physician? Or a healed one?



Is he a poet? Or a genuine one? An emancipator? Or a subjugator? A good

one? Or an evil one?



I walk amongst men as the fragments of the future: that future which I

contemplate.



And it is all my poetisation and aspiration to compose and collect into

unity what is fragment and riddle and fearful chance.
