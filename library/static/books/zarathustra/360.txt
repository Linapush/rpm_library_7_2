confounded with those resentful and revengeful ones who condemn society

FROM BELOW, and whose criticism is only suppressed envy. “There are

those who preach my doctrine of life,” he says of the Nietzschean

Socialists, “and are at the same time preachers of equality and

tarantulas” (see Notes on Chapter XL. and Chapter LI.).



Chapter XXX. The Famous Wise Ones.



This refers to all those philosophers hitherto, who have run in the

harness of established values and have not risked their reputation with

the people in pursuit of truth. The philosopher, however, as Nietzsche

understood him, is a man who creates new values, and thus leads mankind

in a new direction.



Chapter XXXIII. The Grave-Song.



Here Zarathustra sings about the ideals and friendships of his youth.

Verses 27 to 31 undoubtedly refer to Richard Wagner (see Note on Chapter

LXV.).



Chapter XXXIV. Self-Surpassing.



In this discourse we get the best exposition in the whole book of

Nietzsche’s doctrine of the Will to Power. I go into this question

thoroughly in the Note on Chapter LVII.



Nietzsche was not an iconoclast from choice. Those who hastily class him

with the anarchists (or the Progressivists of the last century) fail

to understand the high esteem in which he always held both law and

discipline. In verse 41 of this most decisive discourse he truly

explains his position when he says: “...he who hath to be a creator in

good and evil—verily he hath first to be a destroyer, and break values

in pieces.” This teaching in regard to self-control is evidence enough

of his reverence for law.



Chapter XXXV. The Sublime Ones.



These belong to a type which Nietzsche did not altogether dislike, but

which he would fain have rendered more subtle and plastic. It is the

type that takes life and itself too seriously, that never surmounts the
