same secret.



Rather would I succumb than disown this one thing; and verily, where

there is succumbing and leaf-falling, lo, there doth Life sacrifice

itself—for power!



That I have to be struggle, and becoming, and purpose, and

cross-purpose—ah, he who divineth my will, divineth well also on what

CROOKED paths it hath to tread!



Whatever I create, and however much I love it,—soon must I be adverse

to it, and to my love: so willeth my will.



And even thou, discerning one, art only a path and footstep of my will:

verily, my Will to Power walketh even on the feet of thy Will to Truth!



He certainly did not hit the truth who shot at it the formula: ‘Will to

existence’: that will—doth not exist!



For what is not, cannot will; that, however, which is in existence—how

could it still strive for existence!



Only where there is life, is there also will: not, however, Will to

Life, but—so teach I thee—Will to Power!



Much is reckoned higher than life itself by the living one; but out of

the very reckoning speaketh—the Will to Power!”—



Thus did Life once teach me: and thereby, ye wisest ones, do I solve you

the riddle of your hearts.



Verily, I say unto you: good and evil which would be everlasting—it

doth not exist! Of its own accord must it ever surpass itself anew.



With your values and formulae of good and evil, ye exercise power,

ye valuing ones: and that is your secret love, and the sparkling,

trembling, and overflowing of your souls.



But a stronger power groweth out of your values, and a new surpassing:

by it breaketh egg and egg-shell.
