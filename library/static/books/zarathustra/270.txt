domain!



—For the sake of this did I cast everything else aside, for the sake of

this did everything else become indifferent to me; and close beside my

knowledge lieth my black ignorance.



My spiritual conscience requireth from me that it should be so—that I

should know one thing, and not know all else: they are a loathing unto

me, all the semi-spiritual, all the hazy, hovering, and visionary.



Where mine honesty ceaseth, there am I blind, and want also to be blind.

Where I want to know, however, there want I also to be honest—namely,

severe, rigorous, restricted, cruel and inexorable.



Because THOU once saidest, O Zarathustra: ‘Spirit is life which itself

cutteth into life’;—that led and allured me to thy doctrine. And

verily, with mine own blood have I increased mine own knowledge!”



—“As the evidence indicateth,” broke in Zarathustra; for still was the

blood flowing down on the naked arm of the conscientious one. For there

had ten leeches bitten into it.



“O thou strange fellow, how much doth this very evidence teach

me—namely, thou thyself! And not all, perhaps, might I pour into thy

rigorous ear!



Well then! We part here! But I would fain find thee again. Up thither is

the way to my cave: to-night shalt thou there be my welcome guest!



Fain would I also make amends to thy body for Zarathustra treading upon

thee with his feet: I think about that. Just now, however, a cry of

distress calleth me hastily away from thee.”



Thus spake Zarathustra.
