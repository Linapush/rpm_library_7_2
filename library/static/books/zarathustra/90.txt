When your heart overfloweth broad and full like the river, a blessing

and a danger to the lowlanders: there is the origin of your virtue.



When ye are exalted above praise and blame, and your will would command

all things, as a loving one’s will: there is the origin of your virtue.



When ye despise pleasant things, and the effeminate couch, and cannot

couch far enough from the effeminate: there is the origin of your

virtue.



When ye are willers of one will, and when that change of every need is

needful to you: there is the origin of your virtue.



Verily, a new good and evil is it! Verily, a new deep murmuring, and the

voice of a new fountain!



Power is it, this new virtue; a ruling thought is it, and around it a

subtle soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.



2.



Here paused Zarathustra awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.

Then he continued to speak thus—and his voice had changed:



Remain true to the earth, my brethren, with the power of your virtue!

Let your bestowing love and your knowledge be devoted to be the meaning

of the earth! Thus do I pray and conjure you.



Let it not fly away from the earthly and beat against eternal walls with

its wings! Ah, there hath always been so much flown-away virtue!



Lead, like me, the flown-away virtue back to the earth—yea, back

to body and life: that it may give to the earth its meaning, a human

meaning!



A hundred times hitherto hath spirit as well as virtue flown away

and blundered. Alas! in our body dwelleth still all this delusion and

blundering: body and will hath it there become.
