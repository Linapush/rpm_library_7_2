In all their lamentations soundeth vengeance, in all their eulogies is

maleficence; and being judge seemeth to them bliss.



But thus do I counsel you, my friends: distrust all in whom the impulse

to punish is powerful!



They are people of bad race and lineage; out of their countenances peer

the hangman and the sleuth-hound.



Distrust all those who talk much of their justice! Verily, in their

souls not only honey is lacking.



And when they call themselves “the good and just,” forget not, that for

them to be Pharisees, nothing is lacking but—power!



My friends, I will not be mixed up and confounded with others.



There are those who preach my doctrine of life, and are at the same time

preachers of equality, and tarantulas.



That they speak in favour of life, though they sit in their den, these

poison-spiders, and withdrawn from life—is because they would thereby

do injury.



To those would they thereby do injury who have power at present: for

with those the preaching of death is still most at home.



Were it otherwise, then would the tarantulas teach otherwise: and they

themselves were formerly the best world-maligners and heretic-burners.



With these preachers of equality will I not be mixed up and confounded.

For thus speaketh justice UNTO ME: “Men are not equal.”



And neither shall they become so! What would be my love to the Superman,

if I spake otherwise?



On a thousand bridges and piers shall they throng to the future, and

always shall there be more war and inequality among them: thus doth my

great love make me speak!
