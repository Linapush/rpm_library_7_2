And which of us poets hath not adulterated his wine? Many a poisonous

hotchpotch hath evolved in our cellars: many an indescribable thing hath

there been done.



And because we know little, therefore are we pleased from the heart with

the poor in spirit, especially when they are young women!



And even of those things are we desirous, which old women tell one

another in the evening. This do we call the eternally feminine in us.



And as if there were a special secret access to knowledge, which CHOKETH

UP for those who learn anything, so do we believe in the people and in

their “wisdom.”



This, however, do all poets believe: that whoever pricketh up his ears

when lying in the grass or on lonely slopes, learneth something of the

things that are betwixt heaven and earth.



And if there come unto them tender emotions, then do the poets always

think that nature herself is in love with them:



And that she stealeth to their ear to whisper secrets into it, and

amorous flatteries: of this do they plume and pride themselves, before

all mortals!



Ah, there are so many things betwixt heaven and earth of which only the

poets have dreamed!



And especially ABOVE the heavens: for all Gods are poet-symbolisations,

poet-sophistications!



Verily, ever are we drawn aloft—that is, to the realm of the clouds:

on these do we set our gaudy puppets, and then call them Gods and

Supermen:—



Are not they light enough for those chairs!—all these Gods and

Supermen?—



Ah, how I am weary of all the inadequate that is insisted on as actual!

Ah, how I am weary of the poets!
