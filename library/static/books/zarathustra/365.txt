“The Vision and the Enigma” is perhaps an example of Nietzsche in his

most obscure vein. We must know how persistently he inveighed against

the oppressing and depressing influence of man’s sense of guilt and

consciousness of sin in order fully to grasp the significance of this

discourse. Slowly but surely, he thought the values of Christianity and

Judaic traditions had done their work in the minds of men. What were

once but expedients devised for the discipline of a certain portion of

humanity, had now passed into man’s blood and had become instincts. This

oppressive and paralysing sense of guilt and of sin is what Nietzsche

refers to when he speaks of “the spirit of gravity.” This creature

half-dwarf, half-mole, whom he bears with him a certain distance on his

climb and finally defies, and whom he calls his devil and arch-enemy, is

nothing more than the heavy millstone “guilty conscience,” together with

the concept of sin which at present hangs round the neck of men. To rise

above it—to soar—is the most difficult of all things to-day. Nietzsche

is able to think cheerfully and optimistically of the possibility of

life in this world recurring again and again, when he has once cast the

dwarf from his shoulders, and he announces his doctrine of the Eternal

Recurrence of all things great and small to his arch-enemy and in

defiance of him.



That there is much to be said for Nietzsche’s hypothesis of the Eternal

Recurrence of all things great and small, nobody who has read the

literature on the subject will doubt for an instant; but it remains a

very daring conjecture notwithstanding and even in its ultimate effect,

as a dogma, on the minds of men, I venture to doubt whether Nietzsche

ever properly estimated its worth (see Note on Chapter LVII.).



What follows is clear enough. Zarathustra sees a young shepherd

struggling on the ground with a snake holding fast to the back of his

throat. The sage, assuming that the snake must have crawled into the

young man’s mouth while he lay sleeping, runs to his help and pulls

at the loathsome reptile with all his might, but in vain. At last, in

despair, Zarathustra appeals to the young man’s will. Knowing full well

what a ghastly operation he is recommending, he nevertheless cries,

“Bite! Bite! Its head off! Bite!” as the only possible solution of the

difficulty. The young shepherd bites, and far away he spits the

snake’s head, whereupon he rises, “No longer shepherd, no longer man—a

transfigured being, a light-surrounded being, that LAUGHED! Never on
