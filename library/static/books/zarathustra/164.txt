A horror came over me when I saw those best ones naked: then there grew

for me the pinions to soar away into distant futures.



Into more distant futures, into more southern souths than ever artist

dreamed of: thither, where Gods are ashamed of all clothes!



But disguised do I want to see YOU, ye neighbours and fellowmen, and

well-attired and vain and estimable, as “the good and just;”—



And disguised will I myself sit amongst you—that I may MISTAKE you and

myself: for that is my last manly prudence.—



Thus spake Zarathustra.









XLIV. THE STILLEST HOUR.





What hath happened unto me, my friends? Ye see me troubled, driven

forth, unwillingly obedient, ready to go—alas, to go away from YOU!



Yea, once more must Zarathustra retire to his solitude: but unjoyously

this time doth the bear go back to his cave!



What hath happened unto me? Who ordereth this?—Ah, mine angry mistress

wisheth it so; she spake unto me. Have I ever named her name to you?



Yesterday towards evening there spake unto me MY STILLEST HOUR: that is

the name of my terrible mistress.



And thus did it happen—for everything must I tell you, that your heart

may not harden against the suddenly departing one!



Do ye know the terror of him who falleth asleep?—



To the very toes he is terrified, because the ground giveth way under

him, and the dream beginneth.
