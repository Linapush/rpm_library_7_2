“Halt, dwarf!” said I. “Either I—or thou! I, however, am the stronger

“Look at this gateway! Dwarf!” I continued, “it hath two faces. Two

roads come together here: these hath no one yet gone to the end of.



This long lane backwards: it continueth for an eternity. And that long

lane forward—that is another eternity.



They are antithetical to one another, these roads; they directly abut on

one another:—and it is here, at this gateway, that they come together.

The name of the gateway is inscribed above: ‘This Moment.’



But should one follow them further—and ever further and further

antithetical?”—



“Everything straight lieth,” murmured the dwarf, contemptuously. “All
