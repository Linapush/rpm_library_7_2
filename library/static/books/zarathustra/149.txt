“Up with thee, fire-dog, out of thy depth!” cried I, “and confess how

deep that depth is! Whence cometh that which thou snortest up?



Thou drinkest copiously at the sea: that doth thine embittered eloquence

betray! In sooth, for a dog of the depth, thou takest thy nourishment

too much from the surface!



At the most, I regard thee as the ventriloquist of the earth: and ever,

when I have heard subversive and spouting devils speak, I have found

them like thee: embittered, mendacious, and shallow.



Ye understand how to roar and obscure with ashes! Ye are the best

braggarts, and have sufficiently learned the art of making dregs boil.



Where ye are, there must always be dregs at hand, and much that is

spongy, hollow, and compressed: it wanteth to have freedom.



‘Freedom’ ye all roar most eagerly: but I have unlearned the belief in

‘great events,’ when there is much roaring and smoke about them.



And believe me, friend Hullabaloo! The greatest events—are not our

noisiest, but our stillest hours.



Not around the inventors of new noise, but around the inventors of new

values, doth the world revolve; INAUDIBLY it revolveth.



And just own to it! Little had ever taken place when thy noise and smoke

passed away. What, if a city did become a mummy, and a statue lay in the

mud!



And this do I say also to the o’erthrowers of statues: It is certainly

the greatest folly to throw salt into the sea, and statues into the mud.



In the mud of your contempt lay the statue: but it is just its law, that

out of contempt, its life and living beauty grow again!



With diviner features doth it now arise, seducing by its suffering; and

verily! it will yet thank you for o’erthrowing it, ye subverters!
