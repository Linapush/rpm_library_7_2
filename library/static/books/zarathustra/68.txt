Thus spake Zarathustra.









XIV. THE FRIEND.





“One, is always too many about me”—thinketh the anchorite. “Always once

one—that maketh two in the long run!”



I and me are always too earnestly in conversation: how could it be

endured, if there were not a friend?



The friend of the anchorite is always the third one: the third one is

the cork which preventeth the conversation of the two sinking into the

depth.



Ah! there are too many depths for all anchorites. Therefore, do they

long so much for a friend, and for his elevation.



Our faith in others betrayeth wherein we would fain have faith in

ourselves. Our longing for a friend is our betrayer.



And often with our love we want merely to overleap envy. And often we

attack and make ourselves enemies, to conceal that we are vulnerable.



“Be at least mine enemy!”—thus speaketh the true reverence, which doth

not venture to solicit friendship.



If one would have a friend, then must one also be willing to wage war

for him: and in order to wage war, one must be CAPABLE of being an

enemy.



One ought still to honour the enemy in one’s friend. Canst thou go nigh

unto thy friend, and not go over to him?



In one’s friend one shall have one’s best enemy. Thou shalt be closest

unto him with thy heart when thou withstandest him.
