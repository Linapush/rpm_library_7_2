from the ground. “Alas, if any one else, except Zarathustra, had seen

you:



Every one would think you the worst blasphemers, or the very foolishest

old women, with your new belief!



And thou thyself, thou old pope, how is it in accordance with thee, to

adore an ass in such a manner as God?”—



“O Zarathustra,” answered the pope, “forgive me, but in divine matters

I am more enlightened even than thou. And it is right that it should be

so.



Better to adore God so, in this form, than in no form at all! Think over

this saying, mine exalted friend: thou wilt readily divine that in such

a saying there is wisdom.



He who said ‘God is a Spirit’—made the greatest stride and slide

hitherto made on earth towards unbelief: such a dictum is not easily

amended again on earth!



Mine old heart leapeth and boundeth because there is still something

to adore on earth. Forgive it, O Zarathustra, to an old, pious

pontiff-heart!—”



—“And thou,” said Zarathustra to the wanderer and shadow, “thou callest

and thinkest thyself a free spirit? And thou here practisest such

idolatry and hierolatry?



Worse verily, doest thou here than with thy bad brown girls, thou bad,

new believer!”



“It is sad enough,” answered the wanderer and shadow, “thou art right:

but how can I help it! The old God liveth again, O Zarathustra, thou

mayst say what thou wilt.



The ugliest man is to blame for it all: he hath reawakened him. And

if he say that he once killed him, with Gods DEATH is always just a

prejudice.”
