soul should be ripped up?



MUST I not wear stilts, that they may OVERLOOK my long legs—all those

enviers and injurers around me?



Those dingy, fire-warmed, used-up, green-tinted, ill-natured souls—how

COULD their envy endure my happiness!



Thus do I show them only the ice and winter of my peaks—and NOT that my

mountain windeth all the solar girdles around it!



They hear only the whistling of my winter-storms: and know NOT that I

also travel over warm seas, like longing, heavy, hot south-winds.



They commiserate also my accidents and chances:—but MY word saith:

“Suffer the chance to come unto me: innocent is it as a little child!”



How COULD they endure my happiness, if I did not put around it

accidents, and winter-privations, and bear-skin caps, and enmantling

snowflakes!



—If I did not myself commiserate their PITY, the pity of those enviers

and injurers!



—If I did not myself sigh before them, and chatter with cold, and

patiently LET myself be swathed in their pity!



This is the wise waggish-will and good-will of my soul, that it

CONCEALETH NOT its winters and glacial storms; it concealeth not its

chilblains either.



To one man, lonesomeness is the flight of the sick one; to another, it

is the flight FROM the sick ones.



Let them HEAR me chattering and sighing with winter-cold, all those poor

squinting knaves around me! With such sighing and chattering do I flee

from their heated rooms.



Let them sympathise with me and sigh with me on account of my

chilblains: “At the ice of knowledge will he yet FREEZE TO DEATH!”—so
