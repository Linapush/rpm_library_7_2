are ashamed of their ebb.



Ye are ugly? Well then, my brethren, take the sublime about you, the

mantle of the ugly!



And when your soul becometh great, then doth it become haughty, and in

your sublimity there is wickedness. I know you.



In wickedness the haughty man and the weakling meet. But they

misunderstand one another. I know you.



Ye shall only have enemies to be hated, but not enemies to be despised.

Ye must be proud of your enemies; then, the successes of your enemies

are also your successes.



Resistance—that is the distinction of the slave. Let your distinction

be obedience. Let your commanding itself be obeying!



To the good warrior soundeth “thou shalt” pleasanter than “I will.” And

all that is dear unto you, ye shall first have it commanded unto you.



Let your love to life be love to your highest hope; and let your highest

hope be the highest thought of life!



Your highest thought, however, ye shall have it commanded unto you by

me—and it is this: man is something that is to be surpassed.



So live your life of obedience and of war! What matter about long life!

What warrior wisheth to be spared!



I spare you not, I love you from my very heart, my brethren in war!—



Thus spake Zarathustra.
