not believe that we come with gifts.



The fall of our footsteps ringeth too hollow through their streets. And

just as at night, when they are in bed and hear a man abroad long before

sunrise, so they ask themselves concerning us: Where goeth the thief?



Go not to men, but stay in the forest! Go rather to the animals! Why not

be like me—a bear amongst bears, a bird amongst birds?”



“And what doeth the saint in the forest?” asked Zarathustra.



The saint answered: “I make hymns and sing them; and in making hymns I

laugh and weep and mumble: thus do I praise God.



With singing, weeping, laughing, and mumbling do I praise the God who is

my God. But what dost thou bring us as a gift?”



When Zarathustra had heard these words, he bowed to the saint and said:

“What should I have to give thee! Let me rather hurry hence lest I take

aught away from thee!”—And thus they parted from one another, the old

man and Zarathustra, laughing like schoolboys.



When Zarathustra was alone, however, he said to his heart: “Could it be

possible! This old saint in the forest hath not yet heard of it, that

GOD IS DEAD!”

When Zarathustra arrived at the nearest town which adjoineth the forest,

he found many people assembled in the market-place; for it had been

announced that a rope-dancer would give a performance. And Zarathustra

spake thus unto the people:



I TEACH YOU THE SUPERMAN. Man is something that is to be surpassed. What

have ye done to surpass man?



All beings hitherto have created something beyond themselves: and ye

want to be the ebb of that great tide, and would rather go back to the

beast than surpass man?
