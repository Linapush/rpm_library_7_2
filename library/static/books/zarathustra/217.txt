On their great grave-highway did I seat myself, and even beside the

carrion and vultures—and I laughed at all their bygone and its mellow

decaying glory.



Verily, like penitential preachers and fools did I cry wrath and shame

on all their greatness and smallness. Oh, that their best is so very

small! Oh, that their worst is so very small! Thus did I laugh.



Thus did my wise longing, born in the mountains, cry and laugh in me; a

wild wisdom, verily!—my great pinion-rustling longing.



And oft did it carry me off and up and away and in the midst of

laughter; then flew I quivering like an arrow with sun-intoxicated

rapture:



—Out into distant futures, which no dream hath yet seen, into warmer

souths than ever sculptor conceived,—where gods in their dancing are

ashamed of all clothes:



(That I may speak in parables and halt and stammer like the poets: and

verily I am ashamed that I have still to be a poet!)



Where all becoming seemed to me dancing of Gods, and wantoning of Gods,

and the world unloosed and unbridled and fleeing back to itself:—



—As an eternal self-fleeing and re-seeking of one another of many Gods,

as the blessed self-contradicting, recommuning, and refraternising with

one another of many Gods:—



Where all time seemed to me a blessed mockery of moments, where

necessity was freedom itself, which played happily with the goad of

freedom:—



Where I also found again mine old devil and arch-enemy, the spirit

of gravity, and all that it created: constraint, law, necessity and

consequence and purpose and will and good and evil:—



For must there not be that which is danced OVER, danced beyond? Must

there not, for the sake of the nimble, the nimblest,—be moles and

clumsy dwarfs?—
