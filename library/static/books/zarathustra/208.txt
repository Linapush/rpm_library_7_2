grow upwards?—



Now stand the scales poised and at rest: three heavy questions have I

thrown in; three heavy answers carrieth the other scale.



2.



Voluptuousness: unto all hair-shirted despisers of the body, a sting and

stake; and, cursed as “the world,” by all backworldsmen: for it mocketh

and befooleth all erring, misinferring teachers.



Voluptuousness: to the rabble, the slow fire at which it is burnt;

to all wormy wood, to all stinking rags, the prepared heat and stew

furnace.



Voluptuousness: to free hearts, a thing innocent and free, the

garden-happiness of the earth, all the future’s thanks-overflow to the

present.



Voluptuousness: only to the withered a sweet poison; to the lion-willed,

however, the great cordial, and the reverently saved wine of wines.



Voluptuousness: the great symbolic happiness of a higher happiness

and highest hope. For to many is marriage promised, and more than

marriage,—



—To many that are more unknown to each other than man and woman:—and

who hath fully understood HOW UNKNOWN to each other are man and woman!



Voluptuousness:—but I will have hedges around my thoughts, and

even around my words, lest swine and libertine should break into my

gardens!—



Passion for power: the glowing scourge of the hardest of the heart-hard;

the cruel torture reserved for the cruellest themselves; the gloomy

flame of living pyres.



Passion for power: the wicked gadfly which is mounted on the vainest

peoples; the scorner of all uncertain virtue; which rideth on every

horse and on every pride.
