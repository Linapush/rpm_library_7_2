become too hard for the trembling of filled hands.



Whence have gone the tears of mine eye, and the down of my heart? Oh,

the lonesomeness of all bestowers! Oh, the silence of all shining ones!



Many suns circle in desert space: to all that is dark do they speak with

their light—but to me they are silent.



Oh, this is the hostility of light to the shining one: unpityingly doth

it pursue its course.



Unfair to the shining one in its innermost heart, cold to the

suns:—thus travelleth every sun.



Like a storm do the suns pursue their courses: that is their travelling.

Their inexorable will do they follow: that is their coldness.



Oh, ye only is it, ye dark, nightly ones, that extract warmth from the

shining ones! Oh, ye only drink milk and refreshment from the light’s

udders!



Ah, there is ice around me; my hand burneth with the iciness! Ah, there

is thirst in me; it panteth after your thirst!



‘Tis night: alas, that I have to be light! And thirst for the nightly!

And lonesomeness!



‘Tis night: now doth my longing break forth in me as a fountain,—for

speech do I long.



‘Tis night: now do all gushing fountains speak louder. And my soul also

is a gushing fountain.



‘Tis night: now do all songs of loving ones awake. And my soul also is

the song of a loving one.—



Thus sang Zarathustra.
