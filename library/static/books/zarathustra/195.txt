Hearest thou not how spirit hath here become a verbal game? Loathsome

verbal swill doth it vomit forth!—And they make newspapers also out of

this verbal swill.



They hound one another, and know not whither! They inflame one another,

and know not why! They tinkle with their pinchbeck, they jingle with

their gold.



They are cold, and seek warmth from distilled waters: they are inflamed,

and seek coolness from frozen spirits; they are all sick and sore

through public opinion.



All lusts and vices are here at home; but here there are also the

virtuous; there is much appointable appointed virtue:—



Much appointable virtue with scribe-fingers, and hardy sitting-flesh and

waiting-flesh, blessed with small breast-stars, and padded, haunchless

daughters.



There is here also much piety, and much faithful spittle-licking and

spittle-backing, before the God of Hosts.



“From on high,” drippeth the star, and the gracious spittle; for the

high, longeth every starless bosom.



The moon hath its court, and the court hath its moon-calves: unto all,

however, that cometh from the court do the mendicant people pray, and

all appointable mendicant virtues.



“I serve, thou servest, we serve”—so prayeth all appointable virtue

to the prince: that the merited star may at last stick on the slender

breast!



But the moon still revolveth around all that is earthly: so revolveth

also the prince around what is earthliest of all—that, however, is the

gold of the shopman.



The God of the Hosts of war is not the God of the golden bar; the prince

proposeth, but the shopman—disposeth!
