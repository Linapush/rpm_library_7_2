Ye creating ones, in you there is much uncleanliness. That is because ye

have had to be mothers.



A new child: oh, how much new filth hath also come into the world! Go

apart! He who hath given birth shall wash his soul!



13.



Be not virtuous beyond your powers! And seek nothing from yourselves

opposed to probability!



Walk in the footsteps in which your fathers’ virtue hath already walked!

How would ye rise high, if your fathers’ will should not rise with you?



He, however, who would be a firstling, let him take care lest he also

become a lastling! And where the vices of your fathers are, there should

ye not set up as saints!



He whose fathers were inclined for women, and for strong wine and flesh

of wildboar swine; what would it be if he demanded chastity of himself?



A folly would it be! Much, verily, doth it seem to me for such a one, if

he should be the husband of one or of two or of three women.



And if he founded monasteries, and inscribed over their portals: “The

way to holiness,”—I should still say: What good is it! it is a new

folly!



He hath founded for himself a penance-house and refuge-house: much good

may it do! But I do not believe in it.



In solitude there groweth what any one bringeth into it—also the brute

in one’s nature. Thus is solitude inadvisable unto many.



Hath there ever been anything filthier on earth than the saints of

the wilderness? AROUND THEM was not only the devil loose—but also the

swine.
