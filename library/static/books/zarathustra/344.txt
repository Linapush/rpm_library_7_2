How she just now speaketh soberly, this drunken poetess! hath she

perhaps overdrunk her drunkenness? hath she become overawake? doth she

ruminate?



—Her woe doth she ruminate over, in a dream, the old, deep

midnight—and still more her joy. For joy, although woe be deep, JOY IS

DEEPER STILL THAN GRIEF CAN BE.

Thou grape-vine! Why dost thou praise me? Have I not cut thee! I am

cruel, thou bleedest—: what meaneth thy praise of my drunken cruelty?



“Whatever hath become perfect, everything mature—wanteth to die!” so

sayest thou. Blessed, blessed be the vintner’s knife! But everything

immature wanteth to live: alas!



Woe saith: “Hence! Go! Away, thou woe!” But everything that suffereth

wanteth to live, that it may become mature and lively and longing,



—Longing for the further, the higher, the brighter. “I want heirs,”

 so saith everything that suffereth, “I want children, I do not want

MYSELF,”—



Joy, however, doth not want heirs, it doth not want children,—joy

wanteth itself, it wanteth eternity, it wanteth recurrence, it wanteth

everything eternally-like-itself.



Woe saith: “Break, bleed, thou heart! Wander, thou leg! Thou wing, fly!

Onward! upward! thou pain!” Well! Cheer up! O mine old heart: WOE SAITH:

“HENCE! GO!”

Ye higher men, what think ye? Am I a soothsayer? Or a dreamer? Or a

drunkard? Or a dream-reader? Or a midnight-bell?



Or a drop of dew? Or a fume and fragrance of eternity? Hear ye it not?

Smell ye it not? Just now hath my world become perfect, midnight is also

midday,—
