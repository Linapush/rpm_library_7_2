But of time and of becoming shall the best similes speak: a praise shall

they be, and a justification of all perishableness!



Creating—that is the great salvation from suffering, and life’s

alleviation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed,

and much transformation.



Yea, much bitter dying must there be in your life, ye creators! Thus are

ye advocates and justifiers of all perishableness.



For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also

be willing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the

child-bearer.



Verily, through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred

cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the

heart-breaking last hours.



But so willeth it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more

candidly: just such a fate—willeth my Will.



All FEELING suffereth in me, and is in prison: but my WILLING ever

cometh to me as mine emancipator and comforter.



Willing emancipateth: that is the true doctrine of will and

emancipation—so teacheth you Zarathustra.



No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,

that that great debility may ever be far from me!



And also in discerning do I feel only my will’s procreating and evolving

delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is because there

is will to procreation in it.



Away from God and Gods did this will allure me; what would there be to

create if there were—Gods!



But to man doth it ever impel me anew, my fervent creative will; thus

impelleth it the hammer to the stone.
