LVI. OLD AND NEW TABLES.





1.



Here do I sit and wait, old broken tables around me and also new

half-written tables. When cometh mine hour?



—The hour of my descent, of my down-going: for once more will I go unto

men.



For that hour do I now wait: for first must the signs come unto me that

it is MINE hour—namely, the laughing lion with the flock of doves.



Meanwhile do I talk to myself as one who hath time. No one telleth me

anything new, so I tell myself mine own story.



2.



When I came unto men, then found I them resting on an old infatuation:

all of them thought they had long known what was good and bad for men.



An old wearisome business seemed to them all discourse about virtue; and

he who wished to sleep well spake of “good” and “bad” ere retiring to

rest.



This somnolence did I disturb when I taught that NO ONE YET KNOWETH what

is good and bad:—unless it be the creating one!



—It is he, however, who createth man’s goal, and giveth to the earth

its meaning and its future: he only EFFECTETH it THAT aught is good or

bad.



And I bade them upset their old academic chairs, and wherever that old

infatuation had sat; I bade them laugh at their great moralists, their

saints, their poets, and their Saviours.



At their gloomy sages did I bid them laugh, and whoever had sat

admonishing as a black scarecrow on the tree of life.
