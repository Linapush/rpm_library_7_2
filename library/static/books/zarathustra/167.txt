a child, and be without shame.



The pride of youth is still upon thee; late hast thou become young: but

he who would become a child must surmount even his youth.”—



And I considered a long while, and trembled. At last, however, did I say

what I had said at first. “I will not.”



Then did a laughing take place all around me. Alas, how that laughing

lacerated my bowels and cut into my heart!



And there was spoken unto me for the last time: “O Zarathustra, thy

fruits are ripe, but thou art not ripe for thy fruits!



So must thou go again into solitude: for thou shalt yet become

mellow.”—



And again was there a laughing, and it fled: then did it become still

around me, as with a double stillness. I lay, however, on the ground,

and the sweat flowed from my limbs.



—Now have ye heard all, and why I have to return into my solitude.

Nothing have I kept hidden from you, my friends.



But even this have ye heard from me, WHO is still the most reserved of

men—and will be so!



Ah, my friends! I should have something more to say unto you! I should

have something more to give unto you! Why do I not give it? Am I then a

niggard?—



When, however, Zarathustra had spoken these words, the violence of his

pain, and a sense of the nearness of his departure from his friends came

over him, so that he wept aloud; and no one knew how to console him. In

the night, however, he went away alone and left his friends.
