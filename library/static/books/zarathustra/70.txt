In woman’s love there is injustice and blindness to all she doth not

love. And even in woman’s conscious love, there is still always surprise

and lightning and night, along with the light.



As yet woman is not capable of friendship: women are still cats, and

birds. Or at the best, cows.



As yet woman is not capable of friendship. But tell me, ye men, who of

you are capable of friendship?



Oh! your poverty, ye men, and your sordidness of soul! As much as ye

give to your friend, will I give even to my foe, and will not have

become poorer thereby.



There is comradeship: may there be friendship!



Thus spake Zarathustra.









XV. THE THOUSAND AND ONE GOALS.





Many lands saw Zarathustra, and many peoples: thus he discovered the

good and bad of many peoples. No greater power did Zarathustra find on

earth than good and bad.



No people could live without first valuing; if a people will maintain

itself, however, it must not value as its neighbour valueth.



Much that passed for good with one people was regarded with scorn and

contempt by another: thus I found it. Much found I here called bad,

which was there decked with purple honours.



Never did the one neighbour understand the other: ever did his soul

marvel at his neighbour’s delusion and wickedness.



A table of excellencies hangeth over every people. Lo! it is the table

of their triumphs; lo! it is the voice of their Will to Power.
