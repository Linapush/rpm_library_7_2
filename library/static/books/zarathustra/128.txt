Yea, something invulnerable, unburiable is with me, something that would

rend rocks asunder: it is called MY WILL. Silently doth it proceed, and

unchanged throughout the years.



Its course will it go upon my feet, mine old Will; hard of heart is its

nature and invulnerable.



Invulnerable am I only in my heel. Ever livest thou there, and art like

thyself, thou most patient one! Ever hast thou burst all shackles of the

tomb!



In thee still liveth also the unrealisedness of my youth; and as life

and youth sittest thou here hopeful on the yellow ruins of graves.



Yea, thou art still for me the demolisher of all graves: Hail to thee,

my Will! And only where there are graves are there resurrections.—



Thus sang Zarathustra.









XXXIV. SELF-SURPASSING.





“Will to Truth” do ye call it, ye wisest ones, that which impelleth you

and maketh you ardent?



Will for the thinkableness of all being: thus do _I_ call your will!



All being would ye MAKE thinkable: for ye doubt with good reason whether

it be already thinkable.



But it shall accommodate and bend itself to you! So willeth your will.

Smooth shall it become and subject to the spirit, as its mirror and

reflection.



That is your entire will, ye wisest ones, as a Will to Power; and even

when ye speak of good and evil, and of estimates of value.
