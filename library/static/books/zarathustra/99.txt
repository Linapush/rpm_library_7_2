Ah, ye men, within the stone slumbereth an image for me, the image of my

visions! Ah, that it should slumber in the hardest, ugliest stone!



Now rageth my hammer ruthlessly against its prison. From the stone fly

the fragments: what’s that to me?



I will complete it: for a shadow came unto me—the stillest and lightest

of all things once came unto me!



The beauty of the Superman came unto me as a shadow. Ah, my brethren! Of

what account now are—the Gods to me!—



Thus spake Zarathustra.









XXV. THE PITIFUL.





My friends, there hath arisen a satire on your friend: “Behold

Zarathustra! Walketh he not amongst us as if amongst animals?”



But it is better said in this wise: “The discerning one walketh amongst

men AS amongst animals.”



Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.



How hath that happened unto him? Is it not because he hath had to be

ashamed too oft?



O my friends! Thus speaketh the discerning one: shame, shame,

shame—that is the history of man!



And on that account doth the noble one enjoin upon himself not to abash:

bashfulness doth he enjoin on himself in presence of all sufferers.



Verily, I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their

pity: too destitute are they of bashfulness.
