Thus spake Zarathustra to himself while ascending, comforting his heart

with harsh maxims: for he was sore at heart as he had never been before.

And when he had reached the top of the mountain-ridge, behold, there

lay the other sea spread out before him: and he stood still and was

long silent. The night, however, was cold at this height, and clear and

starry.



I recognise my destiny, said he at last, sadly. Well! I am ready. Now

hath my last lonesomeness begun.



Ah, this sombre, sad sea, below me! Ah, this sombre nocturnal vexation!

Ah, fate and sea! To you must I now GO DOWN!



Before my highest mountain do I stand, and before my longest wandering:

therefore must I first go deeper down than I ever ascended:



—Deeper down into pain than I ever ascended, even into its darkest

flood! So willeth my fate. Well! I am ready.



Whence come the highest mountains? so did I once ask. Then did I learn

that they come out of the sea.



That testimony is inscribed on their stones, and on the walls of their

summits. Out of the deepest must the highest come to its height.—



Thus spake Zarathustra on the ridge of the mountain where it was cold:

when, however, he came into the vicinity of the sea, and at last stood

alone amongst the cliffs, then had he become weary on his way, and

eagerer than ever before.



Everything as yet sleepeth, said he; even the sea sleepeth. Drowsily and

strangely doth its eye gaze upon me.



But it breatheth warmly—I feel it. And I feel also that it dreameth. It

tosseth about dreamily on hard pillows.



Hark! Hark! How it groaneth with evil recollections! Or evil

expectations?
