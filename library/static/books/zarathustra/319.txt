love in spite of me, this Zarathustra: he himself often seemeth to me

like the beautiful mask of a saint,



—Like a new strange mummery in which mine evil spirit, the melancholy

devil, delighteth:—I love Zarathustra, so doth it often seem to me, for

the sake of mine evil spirit.—



But already doth IT attack me and constrain me, this spirit of

melancholy, this evening-twilight devil: and verily, ye higher men, it

hath a longing—



—Open your eyes!—it hath a longing to come NAKED, whether male or

female, I do not yet know: but it cometh, it constraineth me, alas! open

your wits!



The day dieth out, unto all things cometh now the evening, also unto

the best things; hear now, and see, ye higher men, what devil—man or

woman—this spirit of evening-melancholy is!”



Thus spake the old magician, looked cunningly about him, and then seized

his harp.



3.



     In evening’s limpid air,

     What time the dew’s soothings

     Unto the earth downpour,

     Invisibly and unheard—

     For tender shoe-gear wear

     The soothing dews, like all that’s kind-gentle—:

     Bethinkst thou then, bethinkst thou, burning heart,

     How once thou thirstedest

     For heaven’s kindly teardrops and dew’s down-droppings,

     All singed and weary thirstedest,

     What time on yellow grass-pathways

     Wicked, occidental sunny glances

     Through sombre trees about thee sported,

     Blindingly sunny glow-glances, gladly-hurting?



     “Of TRUTH the wooer?  Thou?”—so taunted they—
