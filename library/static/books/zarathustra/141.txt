See there! Surprised and pale doth it stand—before the rosy dawn!



For already she cometh, the glowing one,—HER love to the earth cometh!

Innocence and creative desire, is all solar love!



See there, how she cometh impatiently over the sea! Do ye not feel the

thirst and the hot breath of her love?



At the sea would she suck, and drink its depths to her height: now

riseth the desire of the sea with its thousand breasts.



Kissed and sucked WOULD it be by the thirst of the sun; vapour WOULD it

become, and height, and path of light, and light itself!



Verily, like the sun do I love life, and all deep seas.



And this meaneth TO ME knowledge: all that is deep shall ascend—to my

height!—



Thus spake Zarathustra.









XXXVIII. SCHOLARS.





When I lay asleep, then did a sheep eat at the ivy-wreath on my

head,—it ate, and said thereby: “Zarathustra is no longer a scholar.”



It said this, and went away clumsily and proudly. A child told it to me.



I like to lie here where the children play, beside the ruined wall,

among thistles and red poppies.



A scholar am I still to the children, and also to the thistles and red

poppies. Innocent are they, even in their wickedness.



But to the sheep I am no longer a scholar: so willeth my lot—blessings

upon it!
