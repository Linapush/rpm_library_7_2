My longing for that laughter gnaweth at me: oh, how can I still endure

to live! And how could I endure to die at present!—



Thus spake Zarathustra.









XLVII. INVOLUNTARY BLISS.





With such enigmas and bitterness in his heart did Zarathustra sail o’er

the sea. When, however, he was four day-journeys from the Happy

Isles and from his friends, then had he surmounted all his pain—:

triumphantly and with firm foot did he again accept his fate. And then

talked Zarathustra in this wise to his exulting conscience:



Alone am I again, and like to be so, alone with the pure heaven, and the

open sea; and again is the afternoon around me.



On an afternoon did I find my friends for the first time; on an

afternoon, also, did I find them a second time:—at the hour when all

light becometh stiller.



For whatever happiness is still on its way ‘twixt heaven and earth, now

seeketh for lodging a luminous soul: WITH HAPPINESS hath all light now

become stiller.



O afternoon of my life! Once did my happiness also descend to the valley

that it might seek a lodging: then did it find those open hospitable

souls.



O afternoon of my life! What did I not surrender that I might have

one thing: this living plantation of my thoughts, and this dawn of my

highest hope!



Companions did the creating one once seek, and children of HIS hope: and

lo, it turned out that he could not find them, except he himself should

first create them.
