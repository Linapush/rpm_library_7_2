collecteth a PEOPLE, that is to say, many attempting ones.



Who can command, who must obey—THAT IS THERE ATTEMPTED! Ah, with what

long seeking and solving and failing and learning and re-attempting!



Human society: it is an attempt—so I teach—a long seeking: it seeketh

however the ruler!—



—An attempt, my brethren! And NO “contract”! Destroy, I pray you,

destroy that word of the soft-hearted and half-and-half!



26.



O my brethren! With whom lieth the greatest danger to the whole human

future? Is it not with the good and just?—



—As those who say and feel in their hearts: “We already know what

is good and just, we possess it also; woe to those who still seek

thereafter!”



And whatever harm the wicked may do, the harm of the good is the

harmfulest harm!



And whatever harm the world-maligners may do, the harm of the good is

the harmfulest harm!



O my brethren, into the hearts of the good and just looked some one

once on a time, who said: “They are the Pharisees.” But people did not

understand him.



The good and just themselves were not free to understand him; their

spirit was imprisoned in their good conscience. The stupidity of the

good is unfathomably wise.



It is the truth, however, that the good MUST be Pharisees—they have no

choice!



The good MUST crucify him who deviseth his own virtue! That IS the

truth!
