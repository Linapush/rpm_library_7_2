Zarathustra, however, looked at the people and wondered. Then he spake

thus:



Man is a rope stretched between the animal and the Supermanâ€”a rope over

an abyss.



A dangerous crossing, a dangerous wayfaring, a dangerous looking-back, a

dangerous trembling and halting.



What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not a goal: what is

lovable in man is that he is an OVER-GOING and a DOWN-GOING.



I love those that know not how to live except as down-goers, for they

are the over-goers.



I love the great despisers, because they are the great adorers, and

arrows of longing for the other shore.



I love those who do not first seek a reason beyond the stars for going

down and being sacrifices, but sacrifice themselves to the earth, that

the earth of the Superman may hereafter arrive.



I love him who liveth in order to know, and seeketh to know in

order that the Superman may hereafter live. Thus seeketh he his own

down-going.



I love him who laboureth and inventeth, that he may build the house for

the Superman, and prepare for him earth, animal, and plant: for thus

seeketh he his own down-going.



I love him who loveth his virtue: for virtue is the will to down-going,

and an arrow of longing.



I love him who reserveth no share of spirit for himself, but wanteth to

be wholly the spirit of his virtue: thus walketh he as spirit over the

bridge.
