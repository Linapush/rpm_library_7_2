thing-in-itself.



But it is a sickly thing to them, and gladly would they get out of their

skin. Therefore hearken they to the preachers of death, and themselves

preach backworlds.



Hearken rather, my brethren, to the voice of the healthy body; it is a

more upright and pure voice.



More uprightly and purely speaketh the healthy body, perfect and

square-built; and it speaketh of the meaning of the earth.—



Thus spake Zarathustra.









IV. THE DESPISERS OF THE BODY.





To the despisers of the body will I speak my word. I wish them neither

to learn afresh, nor teach anew, but only to bid farewell to their own

bodies,—and thus be dumb.



“Body am I, and soul”—so saith the child. And why should one not speak

like children?



But the awakened one, the knowing one, saith: “Body am I entirely, and

nothing more; and soul is only the name of something in the body.”



The body is a big sagacity, a plurality with one sense, a war and a

peace, a flock and a shepherd.



An instrument of thy body is also thy little sagacity, my brother, which

thou callest “spirit”—a little instrument and plaything of thy big

sagacity.



“Ego,” sayest thou, and art proud of that word. But the greater

thing—in which thou art unwilling to believe—is thy body with its big

sagacity; it saith not “ego,” but doeth it.
