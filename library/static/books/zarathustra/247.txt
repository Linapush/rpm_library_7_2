—A golden bark saw I gleam on darkened waters, a sinking, drinking,

reblinking, golden swing-bark!



At my dance-frantic foot, dost thou cast a glance, a laughing,

questioning, melting, thrown glance:



Twice only movedst thou thy rattle with thy little hands—then did my

feet swing with dance-fury.—



My heels reared aloft, my toes they hearkened,—thee they would know:

hath not the dancer his ear—in his toe!



Unto thee did I spring: then fledst thou back from my bound; and towards

me waved thy fleeing, flying tresses round!



Away from thee did I spring, and from thy snaky tresses: then stoodst

thou there half-turned, and in thine eye caresses.



With crooked glances—dost thou teach me crooked courses; on crooked

courses learn my feet—crafty fancies!



I fear thee near, I love thee far; thy flight allureth me, thy seeking

secureth me:—I suffer, but for thee, what would I not gladly bear!



For thee, whose coldness inflameth, whose hatred misleadeth, whose

flight enchaineth, whose mockery—pleadeth:



—Who would not hate thee, thou great bindress, inwindress, temptress,

seekress, findress! Who would not love thee, thou innocent, impatient,

wind-swift, child-eyed sinner!



Whither pullest thou me now, thou paragon and tomboy? And now foolest

thou me fleeing; thou sweet romp dost annoy!



I dance after thee, I follow even faint traces lonely. Where art thou?

Give me thy hand! Or thy finger only!



Here are caves and thickets: we shall go astray!—Halt! Stand still!

Seest thou not owls and bats in fluttering fray?
