     No dog—thy game just am I,

     Cruellest huntsman!

     Thy proudest of captives,

     Thou robber ’hind the cloud-banks ...

     Speak finally!

     Thou lightning-veiled one!  Thou unknown one!  Speak!

     What wilt thou, highway-ambusher, from—ME?

     What WILT thou, unfamiliar—God?

     What?

     Ransom-gold?

     How much of ransom-gold?

     Solicit much—that bid’th my pride!

     And be concise—that bid’th mine other pride!



     Ha!  Ha!

     ME—wantest thou?  me?

     —Entire?...



     Ha!  Ha!

     And torturest me, fool that thou art,

     Dead-torturest quite my pride?

     Give LOVE to me—who warm’th me still?

     Who lov’th me still?—

     Give ardent fingers,

     Give heartening charcoal-warmers,

     Give me, the lonesomest,

     The ice (ah! seven-fold frozen ice,

     For very enemies,

     For foes, doth make one thirst),

     Give, yield to me,

     Cruellest foe,

     —THYSELF!—



     Away!

     There fled he surely,

     My final, only comrade,

     My greatest foe,

     Mine unfamiliar—

     My hangman-God!...
