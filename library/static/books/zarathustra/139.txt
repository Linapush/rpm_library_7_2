Also ye love the earth, and the earthly: I have divined you well!—but

shame is in your love, and a bad conscience—ye are like the moon!



To despise the earthly hath your spirit been persuaded, but not your

bowels: these, however, are the strongest in you!



And now is your spirit ashamed to be at the service of your bowels, and

goeth by-ways and lying ways to escape its own shame.



“That would be the highest thing for me”—so saith your lying spirit

unto itself—“to gaze upon life without desire, and not like the dog,

with hanging-out tongue:



To be happy in gazing: with dead will, free from the grip and greed

of selfishness—cold and ashy-grey all over, but with intoxicated

moon-eyes!



That would be the dearest thing to me”—thus doth the seduced one seduce

himself,—“to love the earth as the moon loveth it, and with the eye

only to feel its beauty.



And this do I call IMMACULATE perception of all things: to want nothing

else from them, but to be allowed to lie before them as a mirror with a

hundred facets.”—



Oh, ye sentimental dissemblers, ye covetous ones! Ye lack innocence in

your desire: and now do ye defame desiring on that account!



Verily, not as creators, as procreators, or as jubilators do ye love the

earth!



Where is innocence? Where there is will to procreation. And he who

seeketh to create beyond himself, hath for me the purest will.



Where is beauty? Where I MUST WILL with my whole Will; where I will love

and perish, that an image may not remain merely an image.



Loving and perishing: these have rhymed from eternity. Will to love:

that is to be ready also for death. Thus do I speak unto you cowards!
