 Zarathustra smiled. “When did ever a dragon die of a serpent’s

poison?”—said he. “But take thy poison back! Thou art not rich enough

to present it to me.” Then fell the adder again on his neck, and licked

his wound.



When Zarathustra once told this to his disciples they asked him:

“And what, O Zarathustra, is the moral of thy story?” And Zarathustra

answered them thus:



The destroyer of morality, the good and just call me: my story is

immoral.



When, however, ye have an enemy, then return him not good for evil: for

that would abash him. But prove that he hath done something good to you.



And rather be angry than abash any one! And when ye are cursed, it

pleaseth me not that ye should then desire to bless. Rather curse a

little also!



And should a great injustice befall you, then do quickly five small ones

besides. Hideous to behold is he on whom injustice presseth alone.



Did ye ever know this? Shared injustice is half justice. And he who can

bear it, shall take the injustice upon himself!



A small revenge is humaner than no revenge at all. And if the punishment

be not also a right and an honour to the transgressor, I do not like

your punishing.



Nobler is it to own oneself in the wrong than to establish one’s right,

especially if one be in the right. Only, one must be rich enough to do

so.



I do not like your cold justice; out of the eye of your judges there

always glanceth the executioner and his cold steel.



Tell me: where find we justice, which is love with seeing eyes?



Devise me, then, the love which not only beareth all punishment, but

also all guilt!
