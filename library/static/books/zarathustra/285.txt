is bad.



Art thou angry with me because I have already racked language too long?

Because I have already counselled thee? But know that it is I, the

ugliest man,



—Who have also the largest, heaviest feet. Where _I_ have gone, the way

is bad. I tread all paths to death and destruction.



But that thou passedst me by in silence, that thou blushedst—I saw it

well: thereby did I know thee as Zarathustra.



Every one else would have thrown to me his alms, his pity, in look and

speech. But for that—I am not beggar enough: that didst thou divine.



For that I am too RICH, rich in what is great, frightful, ugliest, most

unutterable! Thy shame, O Zarathustra, HONOURED me!



With difficulty did I get out of the crowd of the pitiful,—that I might

find the only one who at present teacheth that ‘pity is obtrusive’—

thyself, O Zarathustra!



—Whether it be the pity of a God, or whether it be human pity, it is

offensive to modesty. And unwillingness to help may be nobler than the

virtue that rusheth to do so.



THAT however—namely, pity—is called virtue itself at present by

all petty people:—they have no reverence for great misfortune, great

ugliness, great failure.



Beyond all these do I look, as a dog looketh over the backs of thronging

flocks of sheep. They are petty, good-wooled, good-willed, grey people.



As the heron looketh contemptuously at shallow pools, with backward-bent

head, so do I look at the throng of grey little waves and wills and

souls.



Too long have we acknowledged them to be right, those petty people: SO

we have at last given them power as well;—and now do they teach that

‘good is only what petty people call good.’
