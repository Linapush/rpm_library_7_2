There are actors without knowing it amongst them, and actors without

intending it—, the genuine ones are always rare, especially the genuine

actors.



Of man there is little here: therefore do their women masculinise

themselves. For only he who is man enough, will—SAVE THE WOMAN in

woman.



And this hypocrisy found I worst amongst them, that even those who

command feign the virtues of those who serve.



“I serve, thou servest, we serve”—so chanteth here even the hypocrisy

of the rulers—and alas! if the first lord be ONLY the first servant!



Ah, even upon their hypocrisy did mine eyes’ curiosity alight; and well

did I divine all their fly-happiness, and their buzzing around sunny

window-panes.



So much kindness, so much weakness do I see. So much justice and pity,

so much weakness.



Round, fair, and considerate are they to one another, as grains of sand

are round, fair, and considerate to grains of sand.



Modestly to embrace a small happiness—that do they call “submission”!

and at the same time they peer modestly after a new small happiness.



In their hearts they want simply one thing most of all: that no one hurt

them. Thus do they anticipate every one’s wishes and do well unto every

one.



That, however, is COWARDICE, though it be called “virtue.”—



And when they chance to speak harshly, those small people, then do _I_

hear therein only their hoarseness—every draught of air maketh them

hoarse.



Shrewd indeed are they, their virtues have shrewd fingers. But they lack

fists: their fingers do not know how to creep behind fists.
