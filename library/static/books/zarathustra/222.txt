Once did one BELIEVE in soothsayers and astrologers; and THEREFORE did

one believe, “Everything is fate: thou shalt, for thou must!”



Then again did one distrust all soothsayers and astrologers; and

THEREFORE did one believe, “Everything is freedom: thou canst, for thou

willest!”



O my brethren, concerning the stars and the future there hath hitherto

been only illusion, and not knowledge; and THEREFORE concerning good and

evil there hath hitherto been only illusion and not knowledge!

“Thou shalt not rob! Thou shalt not slay!”—such precepts were once

called holy; before them did one bow the knee and the head, and take off

one’s shoes.



But I ask you: Where have there ever been better robbers and slayers in

the world than such holy precepts?



Is there not even in all life—robbing and slaying? And for such

precepts to be called holy, was not TRUTH itself thereby—slain?



—Or was it a sermon of death that called holy what contradicted and

dissuaded from life?—O my brethren, break up, break up for me the old

tables!

It is my sympathy with all the past that I see it is abandoned,—



—Abandoned to the favour, the spirit and the madness of every

generation that cometh, and reinterpreteth all that hath been as its

bridge!



A great potentate might arise, an artful prodigy, who with approval and

disapproval could strain and constrain all the past, until it became for

him a bridge, a harbinger, a herald, and a cock-crowing.
