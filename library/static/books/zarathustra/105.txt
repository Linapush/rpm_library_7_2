Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;

as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! Verily, those

shepherds also were still of the flock!



Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my brethren,

what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto been!



Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their folly

taught that truth is proved by blood.



But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood tainteth the purest

teaching, and turneth it into delusion and hatred of heart.



And when a person goeth through fire for his teaching—what doth that

prove! It is more, verily, when out of one’s own burning cometh one’s

own teaching!



Sultry heart and cold head; where these meet, there ariseth the

blusterer, the “Saviour.”



Greater ones, verily, have there been, and higher-born ones, than those

whom the people call Saviours, those rapturous blusterers!



And by still greater ones than any of the Saviours must ye be saved, my

brethren, if ye would find the way to freedom!



Never yet hath there been a Superman. Naked have I seen both of them,

the greatest man and the smallest man:—



All-too-similar are they still to each other. Verily, even the greatest

found I—all-too-human!—



Thus spake Zarathustra.
