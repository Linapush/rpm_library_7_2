and waiteth, old broken tables around him, and also new

tables—half-written.



4.



Behold, here is a new table; but where are my brethren who will carry it

with me to the valley and into hearts of flesh?—



Thus demandeth my great love to the remotest ones: BE NOT CONSIDERATE OF

THY NEIGHBOUR! Man is something that must be surpassed.



There are many divers ways and modes of surpassing: see THOU thereto!

But only a buffoon thinketh: “man can also be OVERLEAPT.”



Surpass thyself even in thy neighbour: and a right which thou canst

seize upon, shalt thou not allow to be given thee!



What thou doest can no one do to thee again. Lo, there is no requital.



He who cannot command himself shall obey. And many a one CAN command

himself, but still sorely lacketh self-obedience!



5.



Thus wisheth the type of noble souls: they desire to have nothing

GRATUITOUSLY, least of all, life.



He who is of the populace wisheth to live gratuitously; we others,

however, to whom life hath given itself—we are ever considering WHAT we

can best give IN RETURN!



And verily, it is a noble dictum which saith: “What life promiseth US,

that promise will WE keep—to life!”



One should not wish to enjoy where one doth not contribute to the

enjoyment. And one should not WISH to enjoy!



For enjoyment and innocence are the most bashful things. Neither like

to be sought for. One should HAVE them,—but one should rather SEEK for

guilt and pain!—
