But now doth your emasculated ogling profess to be “contemplation!”

 And that which can be examined with cowardly eyes is to be christened

“beautiful!” Oh, ye violators of noble names!



But it shall be your curse, ye immaculate ones, ye pure discerners, that

ye shall never bring forth, even though ye lie broad and teeming on the

horizon!



Verily, ye fill your mouth with noble words: and we are to believe that

your heart overfloweth, ye cozeners?



But MY words are poor, contemptible, stammering words: gladly do I pick

up what falleth from the table at your repasts.



Yet still can I say therewith the truth—to dissemblers! Yea, my

fish-bones, shells, and prickly leaves shall—tickle the noses of

dissemblers!



Bad air is always about you and your repasts: your lascivious thoughts,

your lies, and secrets are indeed in the air!



Dare only to believe in yourselves—in yourselves and in your inward

parts! He who doth not believe in himself always lieth.



A God’s mask have ye hung in front of you, ye “pure ones”: into a God’s

mask hath your execrable coiling snake crawled.



Verily ye deceive, ye “contemplative ones!” Even Zarathustra was once

the dupe of your godlike exterior; he did not divine the serpent’s coil

with which it was stuffed.



A God’s soul, I once thought I saw playing in your games, ye pure

discerners! No better arts did I once dream of than your arts!



Serpents’ filth and evil odour, the distance concealed from me: and that

a lizard’s craft prowled thereabouts lasciviously.



But I came NIGH unto you: then came to me the day,—and now cometh it to

you,—at an end is the moon’s love affair!
