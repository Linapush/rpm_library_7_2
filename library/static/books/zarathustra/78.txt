Thus spake Zarathustra.









XVIII. OLD AND YOUNG WOMEN.





“Why stealest thou along so furtively in the twilight, Zarathustra? And

what hidest thou so carefully under thy mantle?



Is it a treasure that hath been given thee? Or a child that hath been

born thee? Or goest thou thyself on a thief’s errand, thou friend of the

evil?”—



Verily, my brother, said Zarathustra, it is a treasure that hath been

given me: it is a little truth which I carry.



But it is naughty, like a young child; and if I hold not its mouth, it

screameth too loudly.



As I went on my way alone to-day, at the hour when the sun declineth,

there met me an old woman, and she spake thus unto my soul:



“Much hath Zarathustra spoken also to us women, but never spake he unto

us concerning woman.”



And I answered her: “Concerning woman, one should only talk unto men.”



“Talk also unto me of woman,” said she; “I am old enough to forget it

presently.”



And I obliged the old woman and spake thus unto her:



Everything in woman is a riddle, and everything in woman hath one

solution—it is called pregnancy.



Man is for woman a means: the purpose is always the child. But what is

woman for man?
