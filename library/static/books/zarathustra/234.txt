The second one, however, who discovered their country—the country,

heart and soil of the good and just,—it was he who asked: “Whom do they

hate most?”



The CREATOR, hate they most, him who breaketh the tables and old values,

the breaker,—him they call the law-breaker.



For the good—they CANNOT create; they are always the beginning of the

end:—



—They crucify him who writeth new values on new tables, they sacrifice

UNTO THEMSELVES the future—they crucify the whole human future!



The good—they have always been the beginning of the end.—



27.



O my brethren, have ye also understood this word? And what I once said

of the “last man”?—



With whom lieth the greatest danger to the whole human future? Is it not

with the good and just?



BREAK UP, BREAK UP, I PRAY YOU, THE GOOD AND JUST!—O my brethren, have

ye understood also this word?



28.



Ye flee from me? Ye are frightened? Ye tremble at this word?



O my brethren, when I enjoined you to break up the good, and the tables

of the good, then only did I embark man on his high seas.



And now only cometh unto him the great terror, the great outlook, the

great sickness, the great nausea, the great sea-sickness.



False shores and false securities did the good teach you; in the lies of

the good were ye born and bred. Everything hath been radically contorted

and distorted by the good.
