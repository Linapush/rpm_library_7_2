XVII. THE WAY OF THE CREATING ONE.





Wouldst thou go into isolation, my brother? Wouldst thou seek the way

unto thyself? Tarry yet a little and hearken unto me.



“He who seeketh may easily get lost himself. All isolation is wrong”: so

say the herd. And long didst thou belong to the herd.



The voice of the herd will still echo in thee. And when thou sayest,

“I have no longer a conscience in common with you,” then will it be a

plaint and a pain.



Lo, that pain itself did the same conscience produce; and the last gleam

of that conscience still gloweth on thine affliction.



But thou wouldst go the way of thine affliction, which is the way unto

thyself? Then show me thine authority and thy strength to do so!



Art thou a new strength and a new authority? A first motion? A

self-rolling wheel? Canst thou also compel stars to revolve around thee?



Alas! there is so much lusting for loftiness! There are so many

convulsions of the ambitions! Show me that thou art not a lusting and

ambitious one!



Alas! there are so many great thoughts that do nothing more than the

bellows: they inflate, and make emptier than ever.



Free, dost thou call thyself? Thy ruling thought would I hear of, and

not that thou hast escaped from a yoke.



Art thou one ENTITLED to escape from a yoke? Many a one hath cast away

his final worth when he hath cast away his servitude.



Free from what? What doth that matter to Zarathustra! Clearly, however,

shall thine eye show unto me: free FOR WHAT?
