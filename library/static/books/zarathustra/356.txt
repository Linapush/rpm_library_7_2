a life which reaches its consummation in attaining to a second

ingenuousness or in returning to childhood. Nietzsche, the supposed

anarchist, here plainly disclaims all relationship whatever to anarchy,

for he shows us that only by bearing the burdens of the existing law and

submitting to it patiently, as the camel submits to being laden, does

the free spirit acquire that ascendancy over tradition which enables him

to meet and master the dragon “Thou shalt,”—the dragon with the values

of a thousand years glittering on its scales. There are two lessons in

this discourse: first, that in order to create one must be as a little

child; secondly, that it is only through existing law and order that

one attains to that height from which new law and new order may be

promulgated.



Chapter II. The Academic Chairs of Virtue.



Almost the whole of this is quite comprehensible. It is a discourse

against all those who confound virtue with tameness and smug ease, and

who regard as virtuous only that which promotes security and tends to

deepen sleep.



Chapter IV. The Despisers of the Body.



Here Zarathustra gives names to the intellect and the instincts; he

calls the one “the little sagacity” and the latter “the big sagacity.”

 Schopenhauer’s teaching concerning the intellect is fully endorsed here.

“An instrument of thy body is also thy little sagacity, my brother,

which thou callest ‘spirit,’” says Zarathustra. From beginning to end it

is a warning to those who would think too lightly of the instincts

and unduly exalt the intellect and its derivatives: Reason and

Understanding.



Chapter IX. The Preachers of Death.



This is an analysis of the psychology of all those who have the “evil

eye” and are pessimists by virtue of their constitutions.



Chapter XV. The Thousand and One Goals.



In this discourse Zarathustra opens his exposition of the doctrine of

relativity in morality, and declares all morality to be a mere means
