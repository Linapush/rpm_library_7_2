But thou blushest? Have I spoken unspeakable things? Have I abused, when

I meant to bless thee?



Or is it the shame of being two of us that maketh thee blush!—Dost thou

bid me go and be silent, because now—DAY cometh?



The world is deep:—and deeper than e’er the day could read. Not

everything may be uttered in presence of day. But day cometh: so let us

part!



O heaven above me, thou modest one! thou glowing one! O thou, my

happiness before sunrise! The day cometh: so let us part!—



Thus spake Zarathustra.









XLIX. THE BEDWARFING VIRTUE.





1.



When Zarathustra was again on the continent, he did not go straightway

to his mountains and his cave, but made many wanderings and

questionings, and ascertained this and that; so that he said of himself

jestingly: “Lo, a river that floweth back unto its source in many

windings!” For he wanted to learn what had taken place AMONG MEN during

the interval: whether they had become greater or smaller. And once, when

he saw a row of new houses, he marvelled, and said:



“What do these houses mean? Verily, no great soul put them up as its

simile!



Did perhaps a silly child take them out of its toy-box? Would that

another child put them again into the box!



And these rooms and chambers—can MEN go out and in there? They seem to

be made for silk dolls; or for dainty-eaters, who perhaps let others eat

with them.”
