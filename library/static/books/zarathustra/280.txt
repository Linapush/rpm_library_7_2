—“Thou servedst him to the last?” asked Zarathustra thoughtfully, after

a deep silence, “thou knowest HOW he died? Is it true what they say,

that sympathy choked him;



—That he saw how MAN hung on the cross, and could not endure it;—that

his love to man became his hell, and at last his death?”—



The old pope however did not answer, but looked aside timidly, with a

painful and gloomy expression.



“Let him go,” said Zarathustra, after prolonged meditation, still

looking the old man straight in the eye.



“Let him go, he is gone. And though it honoureth thee that thou speakest

only in praise of this dead one, yet thou knowest as well as I WHO he

was, and that he went curious ways.”



“To speak before three eyes,” said the old pope cheerfully (he was blind

of one eye), “in divine matters I am more enlightened than Zarathustra

himself—and may well be so.



My love served him long years, my will followed all his will. A good

servant, however, knoweth everything, and many a thing even which a

master hideth from himself.



He was a hidden God, full of secrecy. Verily, he did not come by his

son otherwise than by secret ways. At the door of his faith standeth

adultery.



Whoever extolleth him as a God of love, doth not think highly enough of

love itself. Did not that God want also to be judge? But the loving one

loveth irrespective of reward and requital.



When he was young, that God out of the Orient, then was he harsh and

revengeful, and built himself a hell for the delight of his favourites.



At last, however, he became old and soft and mellow and pitiful,

more like a grandfather than a father, but most like a tottering old

grandmother.
