This however is the other danger, and mine other sympathy:—he who is

of the populace, his thoughts go back to his grandfather,—with his

grandfather, however, doth time cease.



Thus is all the past abandoned: for it might some day happen for the

populace to become master, and drown all time in shallow waters.



Therefore, O my brethren, a NEW NOBILITY is needed, which shall be the

adversary of all populace and potentate rule, and shall inscribe anew

the word “noble” on new tables.



For many noble ones are needed, and many kinds of noble ones, FOR A NEW

NOBILITY! Or, as I once said in parable: “That is just divinity, that

there are Gods, but no God!”



12.



O my brethren, I consecrate you and point you to a new nobility: ye

shall become procreators and cultivators and sowers of the future;—



—Verily, not to a nobility which ye could purchase like traders with

traders’ gold; for little worth is all that hath its price.



Let it not be your honour henceforth whence ye come, but whither ye go!

Your Will and your feet which seek to surpass you—let these be your new

honour!



Verily, not that ye have served a prince—of what account are princes

now!—nor that ye have become a bulwark to that which standeth, that it

may stand more firmly.



Not that your family have become courtly at courts, and that ye have

learned—gay-coloured, like the flamingo—to stand long hours in shallow

pools:



(For ABILITY-to-stand is a merit in courtiers; and all courtiers believe

that unto blessedness after death pertaineth—PERMISSION-to-sit!)



Nor even that a Spirit called Holy, led your forefathers into promised

lands, which I do not praise: for where the worst of all trees grew—the
