     A such loveliest oasis-belly

     As this is:  though however I doubt about it,

     —With this come I out of Old-Europe,

     That doubt’th more eagerly than doth any

     Elderly married woman.

     May the Lord improve it!

     Amen!



     Here do I sit now,

     In this the smallest oasis,

     Like a date indeed,

     Brown, quite sweet, gold-suppurating,

     For rounded mouth of maiden longing,

     But yet still more for youthful, maidlike,

     Ice-cold and snow-white and incisory

     Front teeth:  and for such assuredly,

     Pine the hearts all of ardent date-fruits.  Selah.



     To the there-named south-fruits now,

     Similar, all-too-similar,

     Do I lie here; by little

     Flying insects

     Round-sniffled and round-played,

     And also by yet littler,

     Foolisher, and peccabler

     Wishes and phantasies,—

     Environed by you,

     Ye silent, presentientest

     Maiden-kittens,

     Dudu and Suleika,

     —ROUNDSPHINXED, that into one word

     I may crowd much feeling:

     (Forgive me, O God,

     All such speech-sinning!)

     —Sit I here the best of air sniffling,

     Paradisal air, truly,

     Bright and buoyant air, golden-mottled,

     As goodly air as ever

     From lunar orb downfell—

     Be it by hazard,
