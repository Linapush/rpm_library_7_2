cross,—in that land there is nothing to praise!—



—And verily, wherever this “Holy Spirit” led its knights, always in

such campaigns did—goats and geese, and wryheads and guyheads run

FOREMOST!—



O my brethren, not backward shall your nobility gaze, but OUTWARD!

Exiles shall ye be from all fatherlands and forefather-lands!



Your CHILDREN’S LAND shall ye love: let this love be your new

nobility,—the undiscovered in the remotest seas! For it do I bid your

sails search and search!



Unto your children shall ye MAKE AMENDS for being the children of your

fathers: all the past shall ye THUS redeem! This new table do I place

over you!

“Why should one live? All is vain! To live—that is to thrash straw; to

live—that is to burn oneself and yet not get warm.”—



Such ancient babbling still passeth for “wisdom”; because it is old,

however, and smelleth mustily, THEREFORE is it the more honoured. Even

mould ennobleth.—



Children might thus speak: they SHUN the fire because it hath burnt

them! There is much childishness in the old books of wisdom.



And he who ever “thrasheth straw,” why should he be allowed to rail at

thrashing! Such a fool one would have to muzzle!



Such persons sit down to the table and bring nothing with them, not even

good hunger:—and then do they rail: “All is vain!”



But to eat and drink well, my brethren, is verily no vain art! Break up,

break up for me the tables of the never-joyous ones!
