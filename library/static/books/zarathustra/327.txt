THE DESERTS GROW: WOE HIM WHO DOTH THEM HIDE!



     —Ha!

     Solemnly!

     In effect solemnly!

     A worthy beginning!

     Afric manner, solemnly!

     Of a lion worthy,

     Or perhaps of a virtuous howl-monkey—

     —But it’s naught to you,

     Ye friendly damsels dearly loved,

     At whose own feet to me,

     The first occasion,

     To a European under palm-trees,

     A seat is now granted.  Selah.



     Wonderful, truly!

     Here do I sit now,

     The desert nigh, and yet I am

     So far still from the desert,

     Even in naught yet deserted:

     That is, I’m swallowed down

     By this the smallest oasis—:

     —It opened up just yawning,

     Its loveliest mouth agape,

     Most sweet-odoured of all mouthlets:

     Then fell I right in,

     Right down, right through—in ’mong you,

     Ye friendly damsels dearly loved!  Selah.



     Hail! hail! to that whale, fishlike,

     If it thus for its guest’s convenience

     Made things nice!—(ye well know,

     Surely, my learned allusion?)

     Hail to its belly,

     If it had e’er
