Everything of to-day—it falleth, it decayeth; who would preserve it!

But I—I wish also to push it!



Know ye the delight which rolleth stones into precipitous depths?—Those

men of to-day, see just how they roll into my depths!



A prelude am I to better players, O my brethren! An example! DO

according to mine example!



And him whom ye do not teach to fly, teach I pray you—TO FALL FASTER!—



21.



I love the brave: but it is not enough to be a swordsman,—one must also

know WHEREON to use swordsmanship!



And often is it greater bravery to keep quiet and pass by, that THEREBY

one may reserve oneself for a worthier foe!



Ye shall only have foes to be hated; but not foes to be despised: ye

must be proud of your foes. Thus have I already taught.



For the worthier foe, O my brethren, shall ye reserve yourselves:

therefore must ye pass by many a one,—



—Especially many of the rabble, who din your ears with noise about

people and peoples.



Keep your eye clear of their For and Against! There is there much right,

much wrong: he who looketh on becometh wroth.



Therein viewing, therein hewing—they are the same thing: therefore

depart into the forests and lay your sword to sleep!



Go YOUR ways! and let the people and peoples go theirs!—gloomy ways,

verily, on which not a single hope glinteth any more!



Let there the trader rule, where all that still glittereth is—traders’

gold. It is the time of kings no longer: that which now calleth itself

the people is unworthy of kings.
