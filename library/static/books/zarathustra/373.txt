Par. 9.



This is complementary to the first three verses of par. 2.



Par. 10.



So far, this is perhaps the most important paragraph. It is a protest

against reading a moral order of things in life. “Life is something

essentially immoral!” Nietzsche tells us in the introduction to the

“Birth of Tragedy”. Even to call life “activity,” or to define it

further as “the continuous adjustment of internal relations to external

relations,” as Spencer has it, Nietzsche characterises as a “democratic

idiosyncracy.” He says to define it in this way, “is to mistake the

true nature and function of life, which is Will to Power.... Life is

ESSENTIALLY appropriation, injury, conquest of the strange and weak,

suppression, severity, obtrusion of its own forms, incorporation and

at least, putting it mildest, exploitation.” Adaptation is merely a

secondary activity, a mere re-activity (see Note on Chapter LVII.).



Pars. 11, 12.



These deal with Nietzsche’s principle of the desirability of rearing a

select race. The biological and historical grounds for his insistence

upon this principle are, of course, manifold. Gobineau in his great

work, “L’Inegalite des Races Humaines”, lays strong emphasis upon the

evils which arise from promiscuous and inter-social marriages. He alone

would suffice to carry Nietzsche’s point against all those who are

opposed to the other conditions, to the conditions which would have

saved Rome, which have maintained the strength of the Jewish race, and

which are strictly maintained by every breeder of animals throughout the

world. Darwin in his remarks relative to the degeneration of CULTIVATED

types of animals through the action of promiscuous breeding, brings

Gobineau support from the realm of biology.



The last two verses of par. 12 were discussed in the Notes on Chapters

XXXVI. and LIII.



Par. 13.



This, like the first part of “The Soothsayer”, is obviously a reference
