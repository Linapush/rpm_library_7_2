Is it not this: To humiliate oneself in order to mortify one’s pride? To

exhibit one’s folly in order to mock at one’s wisdom?



Or is it this: To desert our cause when it celebrateth its triumph? To

ascend high mountains to tempt the tempter?



Or is it this: To feed on the acorns and grass of knowledge, and for the

sake of truth to suffer hunger of soul?



Or is it this: To be sick and dismiss comforters, and make friends of

the deaf, who never hear thy requests?



Or is it this: To go into foul water when it is the water of truth, and

not disclaim cold frogs and hot toads?



Or is it this: To love those who despise us, and give one’s hand to the

phantom when it is going to frighten us?



All these heaviest things the load-bearing spirit taketh upon itself:

and like the camel, which, when laden, hasteneth into the wilderness, so

hasteneth the spirit into its wilderness.



But in the loneliest wilderness happeneth the second metamorphosis: here

the spirit becometh a lion; freedom will it capture, and lordship in its

own wilderness.



Its last Lord it here seeketh: hostile will it be to him, and to its

last God; for victory will it struggle with the great dragon.



What is the great dragon which the spirit is no longer inclined to call

Lord and God? “Thou shalt,” is the great dragon called. But the spirit

of the lion saith, “I will.”



“Thou shalt,” lieth in its path, sparkling with gold—a scale-covered

beast; and on every scale glittereth golden, “Thou shalt!”



The values of a thousand years glitter on those scales, and

thus speaketh the mightiest of all dragons: “All the values of

things—glitter on me.
