those who devise their own virtue—they hate the lonesome ones.



Be on thy guard, also, against holy simplicity! All is unholy to it that

is not simple; fain, likewise, would it play with the fire—of the fagot

and stake.



And be on thy guard, also, against the assaults of thy love! Too readily

doth the recluse reach his hand to any one who meeteth him.



To many a one mayest thou not give thy hand, but only thy paw; and I

wish thy paw also to have claws.



But the worst enemy thou canst meet, wilt thou thyself always be; thou

waylayest thyself in caverns and forests.



Thou lonesome one, thou goest the way to thyself! And past thyself and

thy seven devils leadeth thy way!



A heretic wilt thou be to thyself, and a wizard and a soothsayer, and a

fool, and a doubter, and a reprobate, and a villain.



Ready must thou be to burn thyself in thine own flame; how couldst thou

become new if thou have not first become ashes!



Thou lonesome one, thou goest the way of the creating one: a God wilt

thou create for thyself out of thy seven devils!



Thou lonesome one, thou goest the way of the loving one: thou lovest

thyself, and on that account despisest thou thyself, as only the loving

ones despise.



To create, desireth the loving one, because he despiseth! What knoweth

he of love who hath not been obliged to despise just what he loved!



With thy love, go into thine isolation, my brother, and with thy

creating; and late only will justice limp after thee.



With my tears, go into thine isolation, my brother. I love him who

seeketh to create beyond himself, and thus succumbeth.—
