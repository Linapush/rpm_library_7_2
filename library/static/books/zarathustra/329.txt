     Or supervened it by arrogancy?

     As the ancient poets relate it.

     But doubter, I’m now calling it

     In question:  with this do I come indeed

     Out of Europe,

     That doubt’th more eagerly than doth any

     Elderly married woman.

     May the Lord improve it!

     Amen.



     This the finest air drinking,

     With nostrils out-swelled like goblets,

     Lacking future, lacking remembrances

     Thus do I sit here, ye

     Friendly damsels dearly loved,

     And look at the palm-tree there,

     How it, to a dance-girl, like,

     Doth bow and bend and on its haunches bob,

     —One doth it too, when one view’th it long!—

     To a dance-girl like, who as it seem’th to me,

     Too long, and dangerously persistent,

     Always, always, just on SINGLE leg hath stood?

     —Then forgot she thereby, as it seem’th to me,

     The OTHER leg?

     For vainly I, at least,

     Did search for the amissing

     Fellow-jewel

     —Namely, the other leg—

     In the sanctified precincts,

     Nigh her very dearest, very tenderest,

     Flapping and fluttering and flickering skirting.

     Yea, if ye should, ye beauteous friendly ones,

     Quite take my word:

     She hath, alas! LOST it!

     Hu!  Hu!  Hu!  Hu!  Hu!

     It is away!

     For ever away!

     The other leg!

     Oh, pity for that loveliest other leg!

     Where may it now tarry, all-forsaken weeping?
