When Zarathustra so spake, his disciple resented it, but was silent. And

Zarathustra also was silent; and his eye directed itself inwardly, as if

I am of to-day and heretofore, said he thereupon; but something is in me

that is of the morrow, and the day following, and the hereafter.

they all unto me, and shallow seas.



They did not think sufficiently into the depth; therefore their feeling

did not reach to the bottom.



Some sensation of voluptuousness and some sensation of tedium: these

have as yet been their best contemplation.



Ghost-breathing and ghost-whisking, seemeth to me all the

jingle-jangling of their harps; what have they known hitherto of the

fervour of tones!—



They are also not pure enough for me: they all muddle their water that

it may seem deep.



And fain would they thereby prove themselves reconcilers: but mediaries

and mixers are they unto me, and half-and-half, and impure!—



Ah, I cast indeed my net into their sea, and meant to catch good fish;

but always did I draw up the head of some ancient God.



Thus did the sea give a stone to the hungry one. And they themselves may

well originate from the sea.



Certainly, one findeth pearls in them: thereby they are the more like

hard molluscs. And instead of a soul, I have often found in them salt

slime.



They have learned from the sea also its vanity: is not the sea the

peacock of peacocks?
