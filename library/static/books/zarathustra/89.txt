Ye constrain all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they

shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.



Verily, an appropriator of all values must such bestowing love become;

but healthy and holy, call I this selfishness.—



Another selfishness is there, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which

would always steal—the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.



With the eye of the thief it looketh upon all that is lustrous; with the

craving of hunger it measureth him who hath abundance; and ever doth it

prowl round the tables of bestowers.



Sickness speaketh in such craving, and invisible degeneration; of a

sickly body, speaketh the larcenous craving of this selfishness.



Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not

DEGENERATION?—And we always suspect degeneration when the bestowing

soul is lacking.



Upward goeth our course from genera on to super-genera. But a horror to

us is the degenerating sense, which saith: “All for myself.”



Upward soareth our sense: thus is it a simile of our body, a simile of

an elevation. Such similes of elevations are the names of the virtues.



Thus goeth the body through history, a becomer and fighter. And the

spirit—what is it to the body? Its fights’ and victories’ herald, its

companion and echo.



Similes, are all names of good and evil; they do not speak out, they

only hint. A fool who seeketh knowledge from them!



Give heed, my brethren, to every hour when your spirit would speak in

similes: there is the origin of your virtue.



Elevated is then your body, and raised up; with its delight, enraptureth

it the spirit; so that it becometh creator, and valuer, and lover, and

everything’s benefactor.
