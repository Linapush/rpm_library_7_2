not a finger’s-breadth was it yet open:



Then did a roaring wind tear the folds apart: whistling, whizzing, and

piercing, it threw unto me a black coffin.



And in the roaring, and whistling, and whizzing the coffin burst up, and

spouted out a thousand peals of laughter.



And a thousand caricatures of children, angels, owls, fools, and

child-sized butterflies laughed and mocked, and roared at me.



Fearfully was I terrified thereby: it prostrated me. And I cried with

horror as I ne’er cried before.



But mine own crying awoke me:—and I came to myself.—



Thus did Zarathustra relate his dream, and then was silent: for as yet

he knew not the interpretation thereof. But the disciple whom he loved

most arose quickly, seized Zarathustra’s hand, and said:



“Thy life itself interpreteth unto us this dream, O Zarathustra!



Art thou not thyself the wind with shrill whistling, which bursteth open

the gates of the fortress of Death?



Art thou not thyself the coffin full of many-hued malices and

angel-caricatures of life?



Verily, like a thousand peals of children’s laughter cometh

Zarathustra into all sepulchres, laughing at those night-watchmen and

grave-guardians, and whoever else rattleth with sinister keys.



With thy laughter wilt thou frighten and prostrate them: fainting and

recovering will demonstrate thy power over them.



And when the long twilight cometh and the mortal weariness, even then

wilt thou not disappear from our firmament, thou advocate of life!



New stars hast thou made us see, and new nocturnal glories: verily,

laughter itself hast thou spread out over us like a many-hued canopy.
