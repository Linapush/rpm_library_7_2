must speak of it, be not ashamed to stammer about it.



Thus speak and stammer: “That is MY good, that do I love, thus doth it

please me entirely, thus only do _I_ desire the good.



Not as the law of a God do I desire it, not as a human law or a human

need do I desire it; it is not to be a guide-post for me to superearths

and paradises.



An earthly virtue is it which I love: little prudence is therein, and

the least everyday wisdom.



But that bird built its nest beside me: therefore, I love and cherish

it—now sitteth it beside me on its golden eggs.”



Thus shouldst thou stammer, and praise thy virtue.



Once hadst thou passions and calledst them evil. But now hast thou only

thy virtues: they grew out of thy passions.



Thou implantedst thy highest aim into the heart of those passions: then

became they thy virtues and joys.



And though thou wert of the race of the hot-tempered, or of the

voluptuous, or of the fanatical, or the vindictive;



All thy passions in the end became virtues, and all thy devils angels.



Once hadst thou wild dogs in thy cellar: but they changed at last into

birds and charming songstresses.



Out of thy poisons brewedst thou balsam for thyself; thy cow,

affliction, milkedst thou—now drinketh thou the sweet milk of her

udder.



And nothing evil groweth in thee any longer, unless it be the evil that

groweth out of the conflict of thy virtues.



My brother, if thou be fortunate, then wilt thou have one virtue and no

more: thus goest thou easier over the bridge.
