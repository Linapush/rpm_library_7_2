Through valuation only is there value; and without valuation the nut of

existence would be hollow. Hear it, ye creating ones!



Change of values—that is, change of the creating ones. Always doth he

destroy who hath to be a creator.



Creating ones were first of all peoples, and only in late times

individuals; verily, the individual himself is still the latest

creation.



Peoples once hung over them tables of the good. Love which would rule

and love which would obey, created for themselves such tables.



Older is the pleasure in the herd than the pleasure in the ego: and as

long as the good conscience is for the herd, the bad conscience only

saith: ego.



Verily, the crafty ego, the loveless one, that seeketh its advantage in

the advantage of many—it is not the origin of the herd, but its ruin.



Loving ones, was it always, and creating ones, that created good and

bad. Fire of love gloweth in the names of all the virtues, and fire of

wrath.



Many lands saw Zarathustra, and many peoples: no greater power did

Zarathustra find on earth than the creations of the loving ones—“good”

 and “bad” are they called.



Verily, a prodigy is this power of praising and blaming. Tell me, ye

brethren, who will master it for me? Who will put a fetter upon the

thousand necks of this animal?



A thousand goals have there been hitherto, for a thousand peoples have

there been. Only the fetter for the thousand necks is still lacking;

there is lacking the one goal. As yet humanity hath not a goal.



But pray tell me, my brethren, if the goal of humanity be still lacking,

is there not also still lacking—humanity itself?—
