Shy, ashamed, awkward, like the tiger whose spring hath failed—thus, ye

higher men, have I often seen you slink aside. A CAST which ye made had

failed.



But what doth it matter, ye dice-players! Ye had not learned to play and

mock, as one must play and mock! Do we not ever sit at a great table of

mocking and playing?



And if great things have been a failure with you, have ye yourselves

therefore—been a failure? And if ye yourselves have been a failure,

hath man therefore—been a failure? If man, however, hath been a

failure: well then! never mind!

The higher its type, always the seldomer doth a thing succeed. Ye higher

men here, have ye not all—been failures?



Be of good cheer; what doth it matter? How much is still possible! Learn

to laugh at yourselves, as ye ought to laugh!



What wonder even that ye have failed and only half-succeeded, ye

half-shattered ones! Doth not—man’s FUTURE strive and struggle in you?



Man’s furthest, profoundest, star-highest issues, his prodigious

powers—do not all these foam through one another in your vessel?



What wonder that many a vessel shattereth! Learn to laugh at yourselves,

as ye ought to laugh! Ye higher men, O, how much is still possible!



And verily, how much hath already succeeded! How rich is this earth in

small, good, perfect things, in well-constituted things!



Set around you small, good, perfect things, ye higher men. Their golden

maturity healeth the heart. The perfect teacheth one to hope.

What hath hitherto been the greatest sin here on earth? Was it not the

word of him who said: “Woe unto them that laugh now!”
