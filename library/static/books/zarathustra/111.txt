pleasure-rabble.



Toilsomely did my spirit mount stairs, and cautiously; alms of delight

were its refreshment; on the staff did life creep along with the blind

one.



What hath happened unto me? How have I freed myself from loathing?

Who hath rejuvenated mine eye? How have I flown to the height where no

rabble any longer sit at the wells?



Did my loathing itself create for me wings and fountain-divining powers?

Verily, to the loftiest height had I to fly, to find again the well of

delight!



Oh, I have found it, my brethren! Here on the loftiest height bubbleth

up for me the well of delight! And there is a life at whose waters none

of the rabble drink with me!



Almost too violently dost thou flow for me, thou fountain of delight!

And often emptiest thou the goblet again, in wanting to fill it!



And yet must I learn to approach thee more modestly: far too violently

doth my heart still flow towards thee:â€”



My heart on which my summer burneth, my short, hot, melancholy,

over-happy summer: how my summer heart longeth for thy coolness!



Past, the lingering distress of my spring! Past, the wickedness of my

snowflakes in June! Summer have I become entirely, and summer-noontide!



A summer on the loftiest height, with cold fountains and blissful

stillness: oh, come, my friends, that the stillness may become more

blissful!



For this is OUR height and our home: too high and steep do we here dwell

for all uncleanly ones and their thirst.



Cast but your pure eyes into the well of my delight, my friends! How

could it become turbid thereby! It shall laugh back to you with ITS

purity.
