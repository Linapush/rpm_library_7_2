all glasses; and he who would keep clean amongst men, must know how to

wash himself even with dirty water.



And thus spake I often to myself for consolation: “Courage! Cheer up!

old heart! An unhappiness hath failed to befall thee: enjoy that as

thy—happiness!”



This, however, is mine other manly prudence: I am more forbearing to the

VAIN than to the proud.



Is not wounded vanity the mother of all tragedies? Where, however, pride

is wounded, there groweth up something better than pride.



That life may be fair to behold, its game must be well played; for that

purpose, however, it needeth good actors.



Good actors have I found all the vain ones: they play, and wish people

to be fond of beholding them—all their spirit is in this wish.



They represent themselves, they invent themselves; in their

neighbourhood I like to look upon life—it cureth of melancholy.



Therefore am I forbearing to the vain, because they are the physicians

of my melancholy, and keep me attached to man as to a drama.



And further, who conceiveth the full depth of the modesty of the vain

man! I am favourable to him, and sympathetic on account of his modesty.



From you would he learn his belief in himself; he feedeth upon your

glances, he eateth praise out of your hands.



Your lies doth he even believe when you lie favourably about him: for in

its depths sigheth his heart: “What am _I_?”



And if that be the true virtue which is unconscious of itself—well, the

vain man is unconscious of his modesty!—



This is, however, my third manly prudence: I am not put out of conceit

with the WICKED by your timorousness.
