have again been set! And whenever I lift a curtain, a night-moth rusheth

out of it.



Did it perhaps squat there along with another night-moth? For everywhere

do I smell small concealed communities; and wherever there are closets

there are new devotees therein, and the atmosphere of devotees.



They sit for long evenings beside one another, and say: “Let us again

become like little children and say, ‘good God!’”—ruined in mouths and

stomachs by the pious confectioners.



Or they look for long evenings at a crafty, lurking cross-spider, that

preacheth prudence to the spiders themselves, and teacheth that “under

crosses it is good for cobweb-spinning!”



Or they sit all day at swamps with angle-rods, and on that account think

themselves PROFOUND; but whoever fisheth where there are no fish, I do

not even call him superficial!



Or they learn in godly-gay style to play the harp with a hymn-poet,

who would fain harp himself into the heart of young girls:—for he hath

tired of old girls and their praises.



Or they learn to shudder with a learned semi-madcap, who waiteth in

darkened rooms for spirits to come to him—and the spirit runneth away

entirely!



Or they listen to an old roving howl- and growl-piper, who hath learnt

from the sad winds the sadness of sounds; now pipeth he as the wind, and

preacheth sadness in sad strains.



And some of them have even become night-watchmen: they know now how to

blow horns, and go about at night and awaken old things which have long

fallen asleep.



Five words about old things did I hear yester-night at the garden-wall:

they came from such old, sorrowful, arid night-watchmen.



“For a father he careth not sufficiently for his children: human fathers

do this better!”—
