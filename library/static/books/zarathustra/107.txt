And like the star that goeth out, so is every work of your virtue: ever

is its light on its way and travelling—and when will it cease to be on

its way?



Thus is the light of your virtue still on its way, even when its work

is done. Be it forgotten and dead, still its ray of light liveth and

travelleth.



That your virtue is your Self, and not an outward thing, a skin, or

a cloak: that is the truth from the basis of your souls, ye virtuous

ones!—



But sure enough there are those to whom virtue meaneth writhing under

the lash: and ye have hearkened too much unto their crying!



And others are there who call virtue the slothfulness of their vices;

and when once their hatred and jealousy relax the limbs, their “justice”

 becometh lively and rubbeth its sleepy eyes.



And others are there who are drawn downwards: their devils draw them.

But the more they sink, the more ardently gloweth their eye, and the

longing for their God.



Ah! their crying also hath reached your ears, ye virtuous ones: “What I

am NOT, that, that is God to me, and virtue!”



And others are there who go along heavily and creakingly, like carts

taking stones downhill: they talk much of dignity and virtue—their drag

they call virtue!



And others are there who are like eight-day clocks when wound up; they

tick, and want people to call ticking—virtue.



Verily, in those have I mine amusement: wherever I find such clocks I

shall wind them up with my mockery, and they shall even whirr thereby!



And others are proud of their modicum of righteousness, and for the sake

of it do violence to all things: so that the world is drowned in their

unrighteousness.
