riddles for cracking.



Thus will we have a good repast in a little while. But whoever wish to

eat with us must also give a hand to the work, even the kings. For with

Zarathustra even a king may be a cook.”



This proposal appealed to the hearts of all of them, save that the

voluntary beggar objected to the flesh and wine and spices.



“Just hear this glutton Zarathustra!” said he jokingly: “doth one go

into caves and high mountains to make such repasts?



Now indeed do I understand what he once taught us: Blessed be moderate

poverty!’ And why he wisheth to do away with beggars.”



“Be of good cheer,” replied Zarathustra, “as I am. Abide by thy

customs, thou excellent one: grind thy corn, drink thy water, praise thy

cooking,—if only it make thee glad!



I am a law only for mine own; I am not a law for all. He, however, who

belongeth unto me must be strong of bone and light of foot,—



—Joyous in fight and feast, no sulker, no John o’ Dreams, ready for the

hardest task as for the feast, healthy and hale.

“Strange! Did one ever hear such sensible things out of the mouth of a

Thus spake the king on the right and wondered; the ass however, with

ill-will, said YE-A to his remark. This however was the beginning of

that long repast which is called “The Supper” in the history-books. At

this there was nothing else spoken of but THE HIGHER MAN.
