green and many-hued on this meadow! And how much honey of hope did I

carry hence into my beehives!



Those young hearts have already all become old—and not old even! only

weary, ordinary, comfortable:—they declare it: “We have again become

pious.”



Of late did I see them run forth at early morn with valorous steps: but

the feet of their knowledge became weary, and now do they malign even

their morning valour!



Verily, many of them once lifted their legs like the dancer; to them

winked the laughter of my wisdom:—then did they bethink themselves.

Just now have I seen them bent down—to creep to the cross.



Around light and liberty did they once flutter like gnats and young

poets. A little older, a little colder: and already are they mystifiers,

and mumblers and mollycoddles.



Did perhaps their hearts despond, because lonesomeness had swallowed me

like a whale? Did their ear perhaps hearken yearningly-long for me IN

VAIN, and for my trumpet-notes and herald-calls?



—Ah! Ever are there but few of those whose hearts have persistent

courage and exuberance; and in such remaineth also the spirit patient.

The rest, however, are COWARDLY.



The rest: these are always the great majority, the common-place, the

superfluous, the far too many—those all are cowardly!—



Him who is of my type, will also the experiences of my type meet on the

way: so that his first companions must be corpses and buffoons.



His second companions, however—they will call themselves his

BELIEVERS,—will be a living host, with much love, much folly, much

unbearded veneration.



To those believers shall he who is of my type among men not bind his

heart; in those spring-times and many-hued meadows shall he not believe,

who knoweth the fickly faint-hearted human species!
