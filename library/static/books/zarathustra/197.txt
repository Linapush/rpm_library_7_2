They call thee mine ape, thou foaming fool: but I call thee my

grunting-pig,—by thy grunting, thou spoilest even my praise of folly.



What was it that first made thee grunt? Because no one sufficiently

FLATTERED thee:—therefore didst thou seat thyself beside this filth,

that thou mightest have cause for much grunting,—



—That thou mightest have cause for much VENGEANCE! For vengeance, thou

vain fool, is all thy foaming; I have divined thee well!



But thy fools’-word injureth ME, even when thou art right! And even if

Zarathustra’s word WERE a hundred times justified, thou wouldst ever—DO

wrong with my word!



Thus spake Zarathustra. Then did he look on the great city and sighed,

and was long silent. At last he spake thus:



I loathe also this great city, and not only this fool. Here and there—

there is nothing to better, nothing to worsen.



Woe to this great city!—And I would that I already saw the pillar of

fire in which it will be consumed!



For such pillars of fire must precede the great noontide. But this hath

its time and its own fate.—



This precept, however, give I unto thee, in parting, thou fool: Where

one can no longer love, there should one—PASS BY!—



Thus spake Zarathustra, and passed by the fool and the great city.
