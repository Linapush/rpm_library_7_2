—“Do not talk further,” answered his animals once more; “rather, thou

convalescent, prepare for thyself first a lyre, a new lyre!



For behold, O Zarathustra! For thy new lays there are needed new lyres.



Sing and bubble over, O Zarathustra, heal thy soul with new lays: that

thou mayest bear thy great fate, which hath not yet been any one’s fate!



For thine animals know it well, O Zarathustra, who thou art and must

become: behold, THOU ART THE TEACHER OF THE ETERNAL RETURN,—that is now

THY fate!



That thou must be the first to teach this teaching—how could this great

fate not be thy greatest danger and infirmity!

and ourselves with them, and that we have already existed times without

number, and all things with us.



Thou teachest that there is a great year of Becoming, a prodigy of a

great year; it must, like a sand-glass, ever turn up anew, that it may

anew run down and run out:—



—So that all those years are like one another in the greatest and also

in the smallest, so that we ourselves, in every great year, are like

ourselves in the greatest and also in the smallest.



And if thou wouldst now die, O Zarathustra, behold, we know also how

thou wouldst then speak to thyself:—but thine animals beseech thee not

to die yet!



Thou wouldst speak, and without trembling, buoyant rather with bliss,

for a great weight and worry would be taken from thee, thou patientest

one!—



‘Now do I die and disappear,’ wouldst thou say, ‘and in a moment I am

nothing. Souls are as mortal as bodies.



But the plexus of causes returneth in which I am intertwined,—it will

again create me! I myself pertain to the causes of the eternal return.
