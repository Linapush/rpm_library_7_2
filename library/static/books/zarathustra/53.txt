deep—into the evil.”



“Yea, into the evil!” cried the youth. “How is it possible that thou

hast discovered my soul?”



Zarathustra smiled, and said: “Many a soul one will never discover,

unless one first invent it.”



“Yea, into the evil!” cried the youth once more.



“Thou saidst the truth, Zarathustra. I trust myself no longer since I

sought to rise into the height, and nobody trusteth me any longer; how

doth that happen?



I change too quickly: my to-day refuteth my yesterday. I often overleap

the steps when I clamber; for so doing, none of the steps pardons me.



When aloft, I find myself always alone. No one speaketh unto me; the

frost of solitude maketh me tremble. What do I seek on the height?



My contempt and my longing increase together; the higher I clamber, the

more do I despise him who clambereth. What doth he seek on the height?



How ashamed I am of my clambering and stumbling! How I mock at my

violent panting! How I hate him who flieth! How tired I am on the

height!”



Here the youth was silent. And Zarathustra contemplated the tree beside

which they stood, and spake thus:



“This tree standeth lonely here on the hills; it hath grown up high

above man and beast.



And if it wanted to speak, it would have none who could understand it:

so high hath it grown.



Now it waiteth and waiteth,—for what doth it wait? It dwelleth too

close to the seat of the clouds; it waiteth perhaps for the first

lightning?”
