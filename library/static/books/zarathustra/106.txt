With thunder and heavenly fireworks must one speak to indolent and

somnolent senses.



But beauty’s voice speaketh gently: it appealeth only to the most

awakened souls.



Gently vibrated and laughed unto me to-day my buckler; it was beauty’s

holy laughing and thrilling.



At you, ye virtuous ones, laughed my beauty to-day. And thus came its

voice unto me: “They want—to be paid besides!”



Ye want to be paid besides, ye virtuous ones! Ye want reward for virtue,

and heaven for earth, and eternity for your to-day?



And now ye upbraid me for teaching that there is no reward-giver,

nor paymaster? And verily, I do not even teach that virtue is its own

reward.



Ah! this is my sorrow: into the basis of things have reward and

punishment been insinuated—and now even into the basis of your souls,

ye virtuous ones!



But like the snout of the boar shall my word grub up the basis of your

souls; a ploughshare will I be called by you.



All the secrets of your heart shall be brought to light; and when ye

lie in the sun, grubbed up and broken, then will also your falsehood be

separated from your truth.



For this is your truth: ye are TOO PURE for the filth of the words:

vengeance, punishment, recompense, retribution.



Ye love your virtue as a mother loveth her child; but when did one hear

of a mother wanting to be paid for her love?



It is your dearest Self, your virtue. The ring’s thirst is in you: to

reach itself again struggleth every ring, and turneth itself.
