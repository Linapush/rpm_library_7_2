I am happy to see the marvels the warm sun hatcheth: tigers and palms

and rattle-snakes.



Also amongst men there is a beautiful brood of the warm sun, and much

that is marvellous in the wicked.



In truth, as your wisest did not seem to me so very wise, so found I

also human wickedness below the fame of it.



And oft did I ask with a shake of the head: Why still rattle, ye

rattle-snakes?



Verily, there is still a future even for evil! And the warmest south is

still undiscovered by man.



How many things are now called the worst wickedness, which are only

twelve feet broad and three months long! Some day, however, will greater

dragons come into the world.



For that the Superman may not lack his dragon, the superdragon that

is worthy of him, there must still much warm sun glow on moist virgin

forests!



Out of your wild cats must tigers have evolved, and out of your

poison-toads, crocodiles: for the good hunter shall have a good hunt!



And verily, ye good and just! In you there is much to be laughed at, and

especially your fear of what hath hitherto been called “the devil!”



So alien are ye in your souls to what is great, that to you the Superman

would be FRIGHTFUL in his goodness!



And ye wise and knowing ones, ye would flee from the solar-glow of the

wisdom in which the Superman joyfully batheth his nakedness!



Ye highest men who have come within my ken! this is my doubt of you, and

my secret laughter: I suspect ye would call my Superman—a devil!



Ah, I became tired of those highest and best ones: from their “height”

 did I long to be up, out, and away to the Superman!
