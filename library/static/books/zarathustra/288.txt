LXVIII. THE VOLUNTARY BEGGAR.





When Zarathustra had left the ugliest man, he was chilled and felt

lonesome: for much coldness and lonesomeness came over his spirit, so

that even his limbs became colder thereby. When, however, he wandered

on and on, uphill and down, at times past green meadows, though also

sometimes over wild stony couches where formerly perhaps an impatient

brook had made its bed, then he turned all at once warmer and heartier

again.



“What hath happened unto me?” he asked himself, “something warm and

living quickeneth me; it must be in the neighbourhood.



Already am I less alone; unconscious companions and brethren rove around

me; their warm breath toucheth my soul.”



When, however, he spied about and sought for the comforters of his

lonesomeness, behold, there were kine there standing together on an

eminence, whose proximity and smell had warmed his heart. The kine,

however, seemed to listen eagerly to a speaker, and took no heed of him

who approached. When, however, Zarathustra was quite nigh unto them,

then did he hear plainly that a human voice spake in the midst of the

kine, and apparently all of them had turned their heads towards the

speaker.



Then ran Zarathustra up speedily and drove the animals aside; for he

feared that some one had here met with harm, which the pity of the

kine would hardly be able to relieve. But in this he was deceived; for

behold, there sat a man on the ground who seemed to be persuading

the animals to have no fear of him, a peaceable man and

Preacher-on-the-Mount, out of whose eyes kindness itself preached. “What

dost thou seek here?” called out Zarathustra in astonishment.



“What do I here seek?” answered he: “the same that thou seekest, thou

mischief-maker; that is to say, happiness upon earth.



To that end, however, I would fain learn of these kine. For I tell thee
