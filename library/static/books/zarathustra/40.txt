III. BACKWORLDSMEN.





Once on a time, Zarathustra also cast his fancy beyond man, like all

backworldsmen. The work of a suffering and tortured God, did the world

then seem to me.



The dream—and diction—of a God, did the world then seem to me;

coloured vapours before the eyes of a divinely dissatisfied one.



Good and evil, and joy and woe, and I and thou—coloured vapours did

they seem to me before creative eyes. The creator wished to look away

from himself,—thereupon he created the world.



Intoxicating joy is it for the sufferer to look away from his suffering

and forget himself. Intoxicating joy and self-forgetting, did the world

once seem to me.



This world, the eternally imperfect, an eternal contradiction’s image

and imperfect image—an intoxicating joy to its imperfect creator:—thus

did the world once seem to me.



Thus, once on a time, did I also cast my fancy beyond man, like all

backworldsmen. Beyond man, forsooth?



Ah, ye brethren, that God whom I created was human work and human

madness, like all the Gods!



A man was he, and only a poor fragment of a man and ego. Out of mine own

ashes and glow it came unto me, that phantom. And verily, it came not

unto me from the beyond!



What happened, my brethren? I surpassed myself, the suffering one; I

carried mine own ashes to the mountain; a brighter flame I contrived for

myself. And lo! Thereupon the phantom WITHDREW from me!



To me the convalescent would it now be suffering and torment to believe

in such phantoms: suffering would it now be to me, and humiliation. Thus

speak I to backworldsmen.
