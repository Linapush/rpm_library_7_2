us old anchorites and saints?



Verily, my folly hath grown big in the mountains! Now do I hear six old

fools’ legs rattling behind one another!



But doth Zarathustra need to be frightened by his shadow? Also,

methinketh that after all it hath longer legs than mine.”



Thus spake Zarathustra, and, laughing with eyes and entrails, he stood

still and turned round quickly—and behold, he almost thereby threw his

shadow and follower to the ground, so closely had the latter followed at

his heels, and so weak was he. For when Zarathustra scrutinised him

with his glance he was frightened as by a sudden apparition, so slender,

swarthy, hollow and worn-out did this follower appear.



“Who art thou?” asked Zarathustra vehemently, “what doest thou here? And

why callest thou thyself my shadow? Thou art not pleasing unto me.”



“Forgive me,” answered the shadow, “that it is I; and if I please thee

not—well, O Zarathustra! therein do I admire thee and thy good taste.



A wanderer am I, who have walked long at thy heels; always on the way,

but without a goal, also without a home: so that verily, I lack little

of being the eternally Wandering Jew, except that I am not eternal and

not a Jew.



What? Must I ever be on the way? Whirled by every wind, unsettled,

driven about? O earth, thou hast become too round for me!



On every surface have I already sat, like tired dust have I fallen

asleep on mirrors and window-panes: everything taketh from me, nothing

giveth; I become thin—I am almost equal to a shadow.



After thee, however, O Zarathustra, did I fly and hie longest; and

though I hid myself from thee, I was nevertheless thy best shadow:

wherever thou hast sat, there sat I also.



With thee have I wandered about in the remotest, coldest worlds, like a

phantom that voluntarily haunteth winter roofs and snows.
