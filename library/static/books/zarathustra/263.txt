Thus spake Zarathustra.









LXIII. TALK WITH THE KINGS.





1.



Ere Zarathustra had been an hour on his way in the mountains and

forests, he saw all at once a strange procession. Right on the path

which he was about to descend came two kings walking, bedecked with

crowns and purple girdles, and variegated like flamingoes: they drove

before them a laden ass. “What do these kings want in my domain?” said

Zarathustra in astonishment to his heart, and hid himself hastily behind

a thicket. When however the kings approached to him, he said half-aloud,

like one speaking only to himself: “Strange! Strange! How doth this

harmonise? Two kings do I see—and only one ass!”



Thereupon the two kings made a halt; they smiled and looked towards the

spot whence the voice proceeded, and afterwards looked into each other’s

faces. “Such things do we also think among ourselves,” said the king on

the right, “but we do not utter them.”



The king on the left, however, shrugged his shoulders and answered:

“That may perhaps be a goat-herd. Or an anchorite who hath lived too

long among rocks and trees. For no society at all spoileth also good

manners.”



“Good manners?” replied angrily and bitterly the other king: “what

then do we run out of the way of? Is it not ‘good manners’? Our ‘good

society’?



Better, verily, to live among anchorites and goatherds, than with

our gilded, false, over-rouged populace—though it call itself ‘good

society.’



—Though it call itself ‘nobility.’ But there all is false and foul,

above all the blood—thanks to old evil diseases and worse curers.
