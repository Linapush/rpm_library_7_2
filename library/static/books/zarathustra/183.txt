then carry my beneficent Yea-saying.



A blesser have I become and a Yea-sayer: and therefore strove I long and

was a striver, that I might one day get my hands free for blessing.



This, however, is my blessing: to stand above everything as its own

heaven, its round roof, its azure bell and eternal security: and blessed

is he who thus blesseth!



For all things are baptized at the font of eternity, and beyond good and

evil; good and evil themselves, however, are but fugitive shadows and

damp afflictions and passing clouds.



Verily, it is a blessing and not a blasphemy when I teach that “above

all things there standeth the heaven of chance, the heaven of innocence,

the heaven of hazard, the heaven of wantonness.”



“Of Hazard”—that is the oldest nobility in the world; that gave I back

to all things; I emancipated them from bondage under purpose.



This freedom and celestial serenity did I put like an azure bell above

all things, when I taught that over them and through them, no “eternal

Will”—willeth.



This wantonness and folly did I put in place of that Will, when I taught

that “In everything there is one thing impossible—rationality!”



A LITTLE reason, to be sure, a germ of wisdom scattered from star to

star—this leaven is mixed in all things: for the sake of folly, wisdom

is mixed in all things!



A little wisdom is indeed possible; but this blessed security have I

found in all things, that they prefer—_to dance_ on the feet of chance.



O heaven above me! thou pure, thou lofty heaven! This is now thy purity

unto me, that there is no eternal reason-spider and reason-cobweb:—



—That thou art to me a dancing-floor for divine chances, that thou art

to me a table of the Gods, for divine dice and dice-players!—
