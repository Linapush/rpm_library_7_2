My wild wisdom became pregnant on the lonesome mountains; on the rough

stones did she bear the youngest of her young.



Now runneth she foolishly in the arid wilderness, and seeketh and

seeketh the soft sward—mine old, wild wisdom!



On the soft sward of your hearts, my friends!—on your love, would she

fain couch her dearest one!—



Thus spake Zarathustra.









XXIV. IN THE HAPPY ISLES.





The figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling

the red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.



Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe

now their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and

clear sky, and afternoon.



Lo, what fulness is around us! And out of the midst of superabundance,

it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.



Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas; now,

however, have I taught you to say, Superman.



God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach beyond

your creating will.



Could ye CREATE a God?—Then, I pray you, be silent about all Gods! But

ye could well create the Superman.



Not perhaps ye yourselves, my brethren! But into fathers and forefathers

of the Superman could ye transform yourselves: and let that be your best

creating!—
