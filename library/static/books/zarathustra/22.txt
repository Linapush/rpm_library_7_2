What is the ape to man? A laughing-stock, a thing of shame. And just the

same shall man be to the Superman: a laughing-stock, a thing of shame.



Ye have made your way from the worm to man, and much within you is still

worm. Once were ye apes, and even yet man is more of an ape than any of

the apes.



Even the wisest among you is only a disharmony and hybrid of plant and

phantom. But do I bid you become phantoms or plants?



Lo, I teach you the Superman!



The Superman is the meaning of the earth. Let your will say: The

Superman SHALL BE the meaning of the earth!



I conjure you, my brethren, REMAIN TRUE TO THE EARTH, and believe not

those who speak unto you of superearthly hopes! Poisoners are they,

whether they know it or not.



Despisers of life are they, decaying ones and poisoned ones themselves,

of whom the earth is weary: so away with them!



Once blasphemy against God was the greatest blasphemy; but God died,

and therewith also those blasphemers. To blaspheme the earth is now the

dreadfulest sin, and to rate the heart of the unknowable higher than the

meaning of the earth!



Once the soul looked contemptuously on the body, and then that contempt

was the supreme thing:â€”the soul wished the body meagre, ghastly, and

famished. Thus it thought to escape from the body and the earth.



Oh, that soul was itself meagre, ghastly, and famished; and cruelty was

the delight of that soul!



But ye, also, my brethren, tell me: What doth your body say about

your soul? Is your soul not poverty and pollution and wretched

self-complacency?



Verily, a polluted stream is man. One must be a sea, to receive a

polluted stream without becoming impure.
