she obeyeth with all her love.



Obey, must the woman, and find a depth for her surface. Surface, is

woman’s soul, a mobile, stormy film on shallow water.



Man’s soul, however, is deep, its current gusheth in subterranean

caverns: woman surmiseth its force, but comprehendeth it not.—



Then answered me the old woman: “Many fine things hath Zarathustra said,

especially for those who are young enough for them.



Strange! Zarathustra knoweth little about woman, and yet he is right

about them! Doth this happen, because with women nothing is impossible?



And now accept a little truth by way of thanks! I am old enough for it!



Swaddle it up and hold its mouth: otherwise it will scream too loudly,

the little truth.”



“Give me, woman, thy little truth!” said I. And thus spake the old

woman:



“Thou goest to women? Do not forget thy whip!”—



Thus spake Zarathustra.









XIX. THE BITE OF THE ADDER.





One day had Zarathustra fallen asleep under a fig-tree, owing to the

heat, with his arms over his face. And there came an adder and bit him

in the neck, so that Zarathustra screamed with pain. When he had

taken his arm from his face he looked at the serpent; and then did it

recognise the eyes of Zarathustra, wriggled awkwardly, and tried to get

away. “Not at all,” said Zarathustra, “as yet hast thou not received

my thanks! Thou hast awakened me in time; my journey is yet long.”

 “Thy journey is short,” said the adder sadly; “my poison is fatal.”
