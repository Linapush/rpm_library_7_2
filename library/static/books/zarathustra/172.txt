there were many curious and dangerous things to be heard on board the

ship, which came from afar, and was to go still further. Zarathustra,

however, was fond of all those who make distant voyages, and dislike to

live without danger. And behold! when listening, his own tongue was

at last loosened, and the ice of his heart broke. Then did he begin to

abyss, the spirit of gravity, my devil and arch-enemy.



Upwards:—although it sat upon me, half-dwarf, half-mole; paralysed,

paralysing; dripping lead in mine ear, and thoughts like drops of lead

into my brain.
