Do like unto the wind when it rusheth forth from its mountain-caves:

unto its own piping will it dance; the seas tremble and leap under its

footsteps.



That which giveth wings to asses, that which milketh the lionesses:—

praised be that good, unruly spirit, which cometh like a hurricane unto

all the present and unto all the populace,—



—Which is hostile to thistle-heads and puzzle-heads, and to all

withered leaves and weeds:—praised be this wild, good, free spirit of

the storm, which danceth upon fens and afflictions, as upon meadows!



Which hateth the consumptive populace-dogs, and all the ill-constituted,

sullen brood:—praised be this spirit of all free spirits, the laughing

storm, which bloweth dust into the eyes of all the melanopic and

melancholic!



Ye higher men, the worst thing in you is that ye have none of you

learned to dance as ye ought to dance—to dance beyond yourselves! What

doth it matter that ye have failed!



How many things are still possible! So LEARN to laugh beyond yourselves!

Lift up your hearts, ye good dancers, high! higher! And do not forget

the good laughter!



This crown of the laughter, this rose-garland crown: to you my brethren

do I cast this crown! Laughing have I consecrated; ye higher men, LEARN,

I pray you—to laugh!
