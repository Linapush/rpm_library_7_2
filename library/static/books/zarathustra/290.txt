“Then learnedst thou,” interrupted Zarathustra, “how much harder it is

to give properly than to take properly, and that bestowing well is an

ART—the last, subtlest master-art of kindness.”



“Especially nowadays,” answered the voluntary beggar: “at present, that

is to say, when everything low hath become rebellious and exclusive and

haughty in its manner—in the manner of the populace.



For the hour hath come, thou knowest it forsooth, for the great, evil,

long, slow mob-and-slave-insurrection: it extendeth and extendeth!



Now doth it provoke the lower classes, all benevolence and petty giving;

and the over-rich may be on their guard!



Whoever at present drip, like bulgy bottles out of all-too-small

necks:—of such bottles at present one willingly breaketh the necks.



Wanton avidity, bilious envy, careworn revenge, populace-pride: all

these struck mine eye. It is no longer true that the poor are blessed.

The kingdom of heaven, however, is with the kine.”



“And why is it not with the rich?” asked Zarathustra temptingly, while

he kept back the kine which sniffed familiarly at the peaceful one.



“Why dost thou tempt me?” answered the other. “Thou knowest it thyself

better even than I. What was it drove me to the poorest, O Zarathustra?

Was it not my disgust at the richest?



—At the culprits of riches, with cold eyes and rank thoughts, who pick

up profit out of all kinds of rubbish—at this rabble that stinketh to

heaven,



—At this gilded, falsified populace, whose fathers were pickpockets,

or carrion-crows, or rag-pickers, with wives compliant, lewd and

forgetful:—for they are all of them not far different from harlots—



Populace above, populace below! What are ‘poor’ and ‘rich’ at present!

That distinction did I unlearn,—then did I flee away further and ever

further, until I came to those kine.”
