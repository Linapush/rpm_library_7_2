BESIDE the bad conscience hath hitherto grown all KNOWLEDGE! Break up,

break up, ye discerning ones, the old tables!

When the water hath planks, when gangways and railings o’erspan the

stream, verily, he is not believed who then saith: “All is in flux.”



But even the simpletons contradict him. “What?” say the simpletons, “all

in flux? Planks and railings are still OVER the stream!



“OVER the stream all is stable, all the values of things, the bridges

and bearings, all ‘good’ and ‘evil’: these are all STABLE!”—



Cometh, however, the hard winter, the stream-tamer, then learn even the

wittiest distrust, and verily, not only the simpletons then say: “Should

not everything—STAND STILL?”



“Fundamentally standeth everything still”—that is an appropriate winter

doctrine, good cheer for an unproductive period, a great comfort for

winter-sleepers and fireside-loungers.



“Fundamentally standeth everything still”—: but CONTRARY thereto,

preacheth the thawing wind!



The thawing wind, a bullock, which is no ploughing bullock—a furious

bullock, a destroyer, which with angry horns breaketh the ice! The ice

however—BREAKETH GANGWAYS!



O my brethren, is not everything AT PRESENT IN FLUX? Have not all

railings and gangways fallen into the water? Who would still HOLD ON to

“good” and “evil”?



“Woe to us! Hail to us! The thawing wind bloweth!”—Thus preach, my

brethren, through all the streets!

There is an old illusion—it is called good and evil. Around soothsayers

and astrologers hath hitherto revolved the orbit of this illusion.
