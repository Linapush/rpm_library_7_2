God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to

the conceivable.



Could ye CONCEIVE a God?—But let this mean Will to Truth unto you,

that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the humanly

visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall ye follow out

to the end!



And what ye have called the world shall but be created by you: your

reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And

verily, for your bliss, ye discerning ones!



And how would ye endure life without that hope, ye discerning ones?

Neither in the inconceivable could ye have been born, nor in the

irrational.



But that I may reveal my heart entirely unto you, my friends: IF there

were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! THEREFORE there are no

Gods.



Yea, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, doth it draw me.—



God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this

conjecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creating

one, and from the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?



God is a thought—it maketh all the straight crooked, and all that

standeth reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be

but a lie?



To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even vomiting

to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjecture

such a thing.



Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and

the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!



All the imperishable—that’s but a simile, and the poets lie too much.—
