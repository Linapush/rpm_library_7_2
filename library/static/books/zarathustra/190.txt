Love ever your neighbour as yourselves—but first be such as LOVE

THEMSELVES—



—Such as love with great love, such as love with great contempt!” Thus

speaketh Zarathustra the godless.—



But why talk I, when no one hath MINE ears! It is still an hour too

early for me here.



Mine own forerunner am I among this people, mine own cockcrow in dark

lanes.



But THEIR hour cometh! And there cometh also mine! Hourly do they become

smaller, poorer, unfruitfuller,—poor herbs! poor earth!



And SOON shall they stand before me like dry grass and prairie, and

verily, weary of themselves—and panting for FIRE, more than for water!



O blessed hour of the lightning! O mystery before noontide!—Running

fires will I one day make of them, and heralds with flaming tongues:—



—Herald shall they one day with flaming tongues: It cometh, it is nigh,

THE GREAT NOONTIDE!



Thus spake Zarathustra.









L. ON THE OLIVE-MOUNT.





Winter, a bad guest, sitteth with me at home; blue are my hands with his

friendly hand-shaking.



I honour him, that bad guest, but gladly leave him alone. Gladly do I

run away from him; and when one runneth WELL, then one escapeth him!



With warm feet and warm thoughts do I run where the wind is calm—to the

sunny corner of mine olive-mount.
