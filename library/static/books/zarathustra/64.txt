But the hour presseth them; so they press thee. And also from thee

they want Yea or Nay. Alas! thou wouldst set thy chair betwixt For and

Against?



On account of those absolute and impatient ones, be not jealous, thou

lover of truth! Never yet did truth cling to the arm of an absolute one.



On account of those abrupt ones, return into thy security: only in the

market-place is one assailed by Yea? or Nay?



Slow is the experience of all deep fountains: long have they to wait

until they know WHAT hath fallen into their depths.



Away from the market-place and from fame taketh place all that is great:

away from the market-place and from fame have ever dwelt the devisers of

new values.



Flee, my friend, into thy solitude: I see thee stung all over by the

poisonous flies. Flee thither, where a rough, strong breeze bloweth!



Flee into thy solitude! Thou hast lived too closely to the small and the

pitiable. Flee from their invisible vengeance! Towards thee they have

nothing but vengeance.



Raise no longer an arm against them! Innumerable are they, and it is not

thy lot to be a fly-flap.



Innumerable are the small and pitiable ones; and of many a proud

structure, rain-drops and weeds have been the ruin.



Thou art not stone; but already hast thou become hollow by the numerous

drops. Thou wilt yet break and burst by the numerous drops.



Exhausted I see thee, by poisonous flies; bleeding I see thee, and torn

at a hundred spots; and thy pride will not even upbraid.



Blood they would have from thee in all innocence; blood their bloodless

souls crave forâ€”and they sting, therefore, in all innocence.
