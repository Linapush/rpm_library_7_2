their shame and devotion!



Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it not

those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under the clear

sky?



And only when the clear sky looketh again through ruined roofs, and down

upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls—will I again turn my heart

to the seats of this God.



They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily, there

was much hero-spirit in their worship!



And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing men to

the cross!



As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;

even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavour of charnel-houses.



And he who liveth nigh unto them liveth nigh unto black pools, wherein

the toad singeth his song with sweet gravity.



Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their

Saviour: more like saved ones would his disciples have to appear unto

me!



Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach

penitence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!



Verily, their Saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom’s

seventh heaven! Verily, they themselves never trod the carpets of

knowledge!



Of defects did the spirit of those Saviours consist; but into every

defect had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called

God.



In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and

o’erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great

folly.
