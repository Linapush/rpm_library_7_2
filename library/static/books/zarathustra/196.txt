By all that is luminous and strong and good in thee, O Zarathustra! Spit

on this city of shopmen and return back!



Here floweth all blood putridly and tepidly and frothily through all

veins: spit on the great city, which is the great slum where all the

scum frotheth together!



Spit on the city of compressed souls and slender breasts, of pointed

eyes and sticky fingers—



—On the city of the obtrusive, the brazen-faced, the pen-demagogues and

tongue-demagogues, the overheated ambitious:—



Where everything maimed, ill-famed, lustful, untrustful, over-mellow,

sickly-yellow and seditious, festereth pernicious:—



—Spit on the great city and turn back!—



Here, however, did Zarathustra interrupt the foaming fool, and shut his

mouth.—



Stop this at once! called out Zarathustra, long have thy speech and thy

species disgusted me!



Why didst thou live so long by the swamp, that thou thyself hadst to

become a frog and a toad?



Floweth there not a tainted, frothy, swamp-blood in thine own veins,

when thou hast thus learned to croak and revile?



Why wentest thou not into the forest? Or why didst thou not till the

ground? Is the sea not full of green islands?



I despise thy contempt; and when thou warnedst me—why didst thou not

warn thyself?



Out of love alone shall my contempt and my warning bird take wing; but

not out of the swamp!—
