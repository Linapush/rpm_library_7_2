O Zarathustra, thou stone of wisdom, thou sling-stone, thou

star-destroyer! Thyself threwest thou so high,—but every thrown

stone—must fall!



Condemned of thyself, and to thine own stoning: O Zarathustra, far

indeed threwest thou thy stone—but upon THYSELF will it recoil!”



Then was the dwarf silent; and it lasted long. The silence, however,

oppressed me; and to be thus in pairs, one is verily lonesomer than when

alone!



I ascended, I ascended, I dreamt, I thought,—but everything oppressed

me. A sick one did I resemble, whom bad torture wearieth, and a worse

dream reawakeneth out of his first sleep.—



But there is something in me which I call courage: it hath hitherto

slain for me every dejection. This courage at last bade me stand still

and say: “Dwarf! Thou! Or I!”—



For courage is the best slayer,—courage which ATTACKETH: for in every

attack there is sound of triumph.



Man, however, is the most courageous animal: thereby hath he overcome

every animal. With sound of triumph hath he overcome every pain; human

pain, however, is the sorest pain.



Courage slayeth also giddiness at abysses: and where doth man not stand

at abysses! Is not seeing itself—seeing abysses?



Courage is the best slayer: courage slayeth also fellow-suffering.

Fellow-suffering, however, is the deepest abyss: as deeply as man

looketh into life, so deeply also doth he look into suffering.



Courage, however, is the best slayer, courage which attacketh: it

slayeth even death itself; for it saith: “WAS THAT life? Well! Once

more!”



In such speech, however, there is much sound of triumph. He who hath

ears to hear, let him hear.—
