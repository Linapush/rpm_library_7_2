crusheth him:—



An attempt and a risk seemed all commanding unto me; and whenever it

commandeth, the living thing risketh itself thereby.



Yea, even when it commandeth itself, then also must it atone for its

commanding. Of its own law must it become the judge and avenger and

victim.



How doth this happen! so did I ask myself. What persuadeth the living

thing to obey, and command, and even be obedient in commanding?



Hearken now unto my word, ye wisest ones! Test it seriously, whether

I have crept into the heart of life itself, and into the roots of its

heart!



Wherever I found a living thing, there found I Will to Power; and even

in the will of the servant found I the will to be master.



That to the stronger the weaker shall serve—thereto persuadeth he his

will who would be master over a still weaker one. That delight alone he

is unwilling to forego.



And as the lesser surrendereth himself to the greater that he may have

delight and power over the least of all, so doth even the greatest

surrender himself, and staketh—life, for the sake of power.



It is the surrender of the greatest to run risk and danger, and play

dice for death.



And where there is sacrifice and service and love-glances, there also

is the will to be master. By by-ways doth the weaker then slink into

the fortress, and into the heart of the mightier one—and there stealeth

power.



And this secret spake Life herself unto me. “Behold,” said she, “I am

that WHICH MUST EVER SURPASS ITSELF.



To be sure, ye call it will to procreation, or impulse towards a goal,

towards the higher, remoter, more manifold: but all that is one and the
