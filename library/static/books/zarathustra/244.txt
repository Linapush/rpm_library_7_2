With the storm that is called “spirit” did I blow over thy surging

sea; all clouds did I blow away from it; I strangled even the strangler

called “sin.”



O my soul, I gave thee the right to say Nay like the storm, and to say

Yea as the open heaven saith Yea: calm as the light remainest thou, and

now walkest through denying storms.



O my soul, I restored to thee liberty over the created and the

uncreated; and who knoweth, as thou knowest, the voluptuousness of the

future?



O my soul, I taught thee the contempt which doth not come like

worm-eating, the great, the loving contempt, which loveth most where it

contemneth most.



O my soul, I taught thee so to persuade that thou persuadest even the

grounds themselves to thee: like the sun, which persuadeth even the sea

to its height.



O my soul, I have taken from thee all obeying and knee-bending and

homage-paying; I have myself given thee the names, “Change of need” and

“Fate.”



O my soul, I have given thee new names and gay-coloured playthings,

I have called thee “Fate” and “the Circuit of circuits” and “the

Navel-string of time” and “the Azure bell.”



O my soul, to thy domain gave I all wisdom to drink, all new wines, and

also all immemorially old strong wines of wisdom.



O my soul, every sun shed I upon thee, and every night and every silence

and every longing:—then grewest thou up for me as a vine.



O my soul, exuberant and heavy dost thou now stand forth, a vine with

swelling udders and full clusters of brown golden grapes:—



—Filled and weighted by thy happiness, waiting from superabundance, and

yet ashamed of thy waiting.
