Somewhere there are still peoples and herds, but not with us, my

brethren: here there are states.



A state? What is that? Well! open now your ears unto me, for now will I

say unto you my word concerning the death of peoples.



A state, is called the coldest of all cold monsters. Coldly lieth

it also; and this lie creepeth from its mouth: “I, the state, am the

people.”



It is a lie! Creators were they who created peoples, and hung a faith

and a love over them: thus they served life.



Destroyers, are they who lay snares for many, and call it the state:

they hang a sword and a hundred cravings over them.



Where there is still a people, there the state is not understood, but

hated as the evil eye, and as sin against laws and customs.



This sign I give unto you: every people speaketh its language of good

and evil: this its neighbour understandeth not. Its language hath it

devised for itself in laws and customs.



But the state lieth in all languages of good and evil; and whatever it

saith it lieth; and whatever it hath it hath stolen.



False is everything in it; with stolen teeth it biteth, the biting one.

False are even its bowels.



Confusion of language of good and evil; this sign I give unto you as

the sign of the state. Verily, the will to death, indicateth this sign!

Verily, it beckoneth unto the preachers of death!



Many too many are born: for the superfluous ones was the state devised!



See just how it enticeth them to it, the many-too-many! How it

swalloweth and cheweth and recheweth them!



“On earth there is nothing greater than I: it is I who am the regulating

finger of God”—thus roareth the monster. And not only the long-eared
