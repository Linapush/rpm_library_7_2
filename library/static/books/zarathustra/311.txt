false deeds.



Take good care there, ye higher men! For nothing is more precious to me,

and rarer, than honesty.



Is this to-day not that of the populace? The populace however knoweth

not what is great and what is small, what is straight and what is

honest: it is innocently crooked, it ever lieth.

Have a good distrust to-day ye, higher men, ye enheartened ones! Ye

open-hearted ones! And keep your reasons secret! For this to-day is that

of the populace.



What the populace once learned to believe without reasons, who could—

refute it to them by means of reasons?



And on the market-place one convinceth with gestures. But reasons make

the populace distrustful.



And when truth hath once triumphed there, then ask yourselves with good

distrust: “What strong error hath fought for it?”



Be on your guard also against the learned! They hate you, because they

are unproductive! They have cold, withered eyes before which every bird

is unplumed.



Such persons vaunt about not lying: but inability to lie is still far

from being love to truth. Be on your guard!



Freedom from fever is still far from being knowledge! Refrigerated

spirits I do not believe in. He who cannot lie, doth not know what truth

is.



10.



If ye would go up high, then use your own legs! Do not get yourselves

CARRIED aloft; do not seat yourselves on other people’s backs and heads!
