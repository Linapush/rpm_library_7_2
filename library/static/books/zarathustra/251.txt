LX. THE SEVEN SEALS.



(OR THE YE-A AND AMEN LAY.)





1.



If I be a diviner and full of the divining spirit which wandereth on

high mountain-ridges, ‘twixt two seas,—



Wandereth ‘twixt the past and the future as a heavy cloud—hostile to

sultry plains, and to all that is weary and can neither die nor live:



Ready for lightning in its dark bosom, and for the redeeming flash of

light, charged with lightnings which say Yea! which laugh Yea! ready for

divining flashes of lightning:—



—Blessed, however, is he who is thus charged! And verily, long must he

hang like a heavy tempest on the mountain, who shall one day kindle the

light of the future!—



Oh, how could I not be ardent for Eternity and for the marriage-ring of

rings—the ring of the return?
