Never yet have I found the woman by whom I should like to have children,

unless it be this woman whom I love: for I love thee, O Eternity!



FOR I LOVE THEE, O ETERNITY!

If ever my wrath hath burst graves, shifted landmarks, or rolled old

shattered tables into precipitous depths:



If ever my scorn hath scattered mouldered words to the winds, and if I

have come like a besom to cross-spiders, and as a cleansing wind to old

charnel-houses:



If ever I have sat rejoicing where old Gods lie buried, world-blessing,

world-loving, beside the monuments of old world-maligners:—



—For even churches and Gods’-graves do I love, if only heaven looketh

through their ruined roofs with pure eyes; gladly do I sit like grass

and red poppies on ruined churches—



Oh, how could I not be ardent for Eternity, and for the marriage-ring of

rings—the ring of the return?



Never yet have I found the woman by whom I should like to have children,

unless it be this woman whom I love: for I love thee, O Eternity!



FOR I LOVE THEE, O ETERNITY!



3.



If ever a breath hath come to me of the creative breath, and of the

heavenly necessity which compelleth even chances to dance star-dances:



If ever I have laughed with the laughter of the creative lightning,

to which the long thunder of the deed followeth, grumblingly, but

obediently:



If ever I have played dice with the Gods at the divine table of

the earth, so that the earth quaked and ruptured, and snorted forth
