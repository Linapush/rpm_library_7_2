“who dareth to speak thus unto ME, the greatest man now living?”—and a

green flash shot from his eye at Zarathustra. But immediately after he

changed, and said sadly:



“O Zarathustra, I am weary of it, I am disgusted with mine arts, I am

not GREAT, why do I dissemble! But thou knowest it well—I sought for

greatness!



A great man I wanted to appear, and persuaded many; but the lie hath

been beyond my power. On it do I collapse.



O Zarathustra, everything is a lie in me; but that I collapse—this my

collapsing is GENUINE!”—



“It honoureth thee,” said Zarathustra gloomily, looking down with

sidelong glance, “it honoureth thee that thou soughtest for greatness,

but it betrayeth thee also. Thou art not great.



Thou bad old magician, THAT is the best and the honestest thing I honour

in thee, that thou hast become weary of thyself, and hast expressed it:

‘I am not great.’



THEREIN do I honour thee as a penitent-in-spirit, and although only for

the twinkling of an eye, in that one moment wast thou—genuine.



But tell me, what seekest thou here in MY forests and rocks? And if thou

hast put thyself in MY way, what proof of me wouldst thou have?—



—Wherein didst thou put ME to the test?”



Thus spake Zarathustra, and his eyes sparkled. But the old magician kept

silence for a while; then said he: “Did I put thee to the test? I—seek

only.



O Zarathustra, I seek a genuine one, a right one, a simple one, an

unequivocal one, a man of perfect honesty, a vessel of wisdom, a saint

of knowledge, a great man!



Knowest thou it not, O Zarathustra? I SEEK ZARATHUSTRA.”
