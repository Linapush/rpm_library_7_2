It is laudable, what they think hard; what is indispensable and hard

they call good; and what relieveth in the direst distress, the unique

and hardest of all,—they extol as holy.



Whatever maketh them rule and conquer and shine, to the dismay and envy

of their neighbours, they regard as the high and foremost thing, the

test and the meaning of all else.



Verily, my brother, if thou knewest but a people’s need, its land,

its sky, and its neighbour, then wouldst thou divine the law of its

surmountings, and why it climbeth up that ladder to its hope.



“Always shalt thou be the foremost and prominent above others: no one

shall thy jealous soul love, except a friend”—that made the soul of a

Greek thrill: thereby went he his way to greatness.



“To speak truth, and be skilful with bow and arrow”—so seemed it alike

pleasing and hard to the people from whom cometh my name—the name which

is alike pleasing and hard to me.



“To honour father and mother, and from the root of the soul to do their

will”—this table of surmounting hung another people over them, and

became powerful and permanent thereby.



“To have fidelity, and for the sake of fidelity to risk honour and

blood, even in evil and dangerous courses”—teaching itself so, another

people mastered itself, and thus mastering itself, became pregnant and

heavy with great hopes.



Verily, men have given unto themselves all their good and bad. Verily,

they took it not, they found it not, it came not unto them as a voice

from heaven.



Values did man only assign to things in order to maintain himself—he

created only the significance of things, a human significance!

Therefore, calleth he himself “man,” that is, the valuator.



Valuing is creating: hear it, ye creating ones! Valuation itself is the

treasure and jewel of the valued things.
