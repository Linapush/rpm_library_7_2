When Zarathustra had said this, the youth called out with violent

gestures: “Yea, Zarathustra, thou speakest the truth. My destruction

I longed for, when I desired to be on the height, and thou art the

lightning for which I waited! Lo! what have I been since thou hast

appeared amongst us? It is mine envy of thee that hath destroyed

me!”—Thus spake the youth, and wept bitterly. Zarathustra, however, put

his arm about him, and led the youth away with him.



And when they had walked a while together, Zarathustra began to speak

thus:



It rendeth my heart. Better than thy words express it, thine eyes tell

me all thy danger.



As yet thou art not free; thou still SEEKEST freedom. Too unslept hath

thy seeking made thee, and too wakeful.



On the open height wouldst thou be; for the stars thirsteth thy soul.

But thy bad impulses also thirst for freedom.



Thy wild dogs want liberty; they bark for joy in their cellar when thy

spirit endeavoureth to open all prison doors.



Still art thou a prisoner—it seemeth to me—who deviseth liberty

for himself: ah! sharp becometh the soul of such prisoners, but also

deceitful and wicked.



To purify himself, is still necessary for the freedman of the spirit.

Much of the prison and the mould still remaineth in him: pure hath his

eye still to become.



Yea, I know thy danger. But by my love and hope I conjure thee: cast not

thy love and hope away!



Noble thou feelest thyself still, and noble others also feel thee still,

though they bear thee a grudge and cast evil looks. Know this, that to

everybody a noble one standeth in the way.



Also to the good, a noble one standeth in the way: and even when they

call him a good man, they want thereby to put him aside.
