flee?



As a blind one did I once walk in blessed ways: then did ye cast

filth on the blind one’s course: and now is he disgusted with the old

footpath.



And when I performed my hardest task, and celebrated the triumph of

my victories, then did ye make those who loved me call out that I then

grieved them most.



Verily, it was always your doing: ye embittered to me my best honey, and

the diligence of my best bees.



To my charity have ye ever sent the most impudent beggars; around my

sympathy have ye ever crowded the incurably shameless. Thus have ye

wounded the faith of my virtue.



And when I offered my holiest as a sacrifice, immediately did your

“piety” put its fatter gifts beside it: so that my holiest suffocated in

the fumes of your fat.



And once did I want to dance as I had never yet danced: beyond all

heavens did I want to dance. Then did ye seduce my favourite minstrel.



And now hath he struck up an awful, melancholy air; alas, he tooted as a

mournful horn to mine ear!



Murderous minstrel, instrument of evil, most innocent instrument!

Already did I stand prepared for the best dance: then didst thou slay my

rapture with thy tones!



Only in the dance do I know how to speak the parable of the highest

things:—and now hath my grandest parable remained unspoken in my limbs!



Unspoken and unrealised hath my highest hope remained! And there have

perished for me all the visions and consolations of my youth!



How did I ever bear it? How did I survive and surmount such wounds? How

did my soul rise again out of those sepulchres?
