Even before the ugliest of all buffaloes doth it spread out its tail;

never doth it tire of its lace-fan of silver and silk.



Disdainfully doth the buffalo glance thereat, nigh to the sand with its

soul, nigher still to the thicket, nighest, however, to the swamp.



What is beauty and sea and peacock-splendour to it! This parable I speak

unto the poets.



Verily, their spirit itself is the peacock of peacocks, and a sea of

vanity!



Spectators, seeketh the spirit of the poet—should they even be

buffaloes!—



But of this spirit became I weary; and I see the time coming when it

will become weary of itself.



Yea, changed have I seen the poets, and their glance turned towards

themselves.



Penitents of the spirit have I seen appearing; they grew out of the

poets.—



Thus spake Zarathustra.









XL. GREAT EVENTS.





There is an isle in the sea—not far from the Happy Isles of

Zarathustra—on which a volcano ever smoketh; of which isle the people,

and especially the old women amongst them, say that it is placed as a

rock before the gate of the nether-world; but that through the volcano

itself the narrow way leadeth downwards which conducteth to this gate.



Now about the time that Zarathustra sojourned on the Happy Isles, it

happened that a ship anchored at the isle on which standeth the smoking
