Inventors of figures and phantoms shall they be in their hostilities;

and with those figures and phantoms shall they yet fight with each other

the supreme fight!



Good and evil, and rich and poor, and high and low, and all names of

values: weapons shall they be, and sounding signs, that life must again

and again surpass itself!



Aloft will it build itself with columns and stairs—life itself: into

remote distances would it gaze, and out towards blissful beauties—

THEREFORE doth it require elevation!



And because it requireth elevation, therefore doth it require steps, and

variance of steps and climbers! To rise striveth life, and in rising to

surpass itself.



And just behold, my friends! Here where the tarantula’s den is, riseth

aloft an ancient temple’s ruins—just behold it with enlightened eyes!



Verily, he who here towered aloft his thoughts in stone, knew as well as

the wisest ones about the secret of life!



That there is struggle and inequality even in beauty, and war for power

and supremacy: that doth he here teach us in the plainest parable.



How divinely do vault and arch here contrast in the struggle: how with

light and shade they strive against each other, the divinely striving

ones.—



Thus, steadfast and beautiful, let us also be enemies, my friends!

Divinely will we strive AGAINST one another!—



Alas! There hath the tarantula bit me myself, mine old enemy! Divinely

steadfast and beautiful, it hath bit me on the finger!



“Punishment must there be, and justice”—so thinketh it: “not

gratuitously shall he here sing songs in honour of enmity!”



Yea, it hath revenged itself! And alas! now will it make my soul also

dizzy with revenge!
