I would have thy victory and freedom long for a child. Living monuments

shalt thou build to thy victory and emancipation.



Beyond thyself shalt thou build. But first of all must thou be built

thyself, rectangular in body and soul.



Not only onward shalt thou propagate thyself, but upward! For that

purpose may the garden of marriage help thee!



A higher body shalt thou create, a first movement, a spontaneously

rolling wheel—a creating one shalt thou create.



Marriage: so call I the will of the twain to create the one that is

more than those who created it. The reverence for one another, as those

exercising such a will, call I marriage.



Let this be the significance and the truth of thy marriage. But that

which the many-too-many call marriage, those superfluous ones—ah, what

shall I call it?



Ah, the poverty of soul in the twain! Ah, the filth of soul in the

twain! Ah, the pitiable self-complacency in the twain!



Marriage they call it all; and they say their marriages are made in

heaven.



Well, I do not like it, that heaven of the superfluous! No, I do not

like them, those animals tangled in the heavenly toils!



Far from me also be the God who limpeth thither to bless what he hath

not matched!



Laugh not at such marriages! What child hath not had reason to weep over

its parents?



Worthy did this man seem, and ripe for the meaning of the earth: but

when I saw his wife, the earth seemed to me a home for madcaps.



Yea, I would that the earth shook with convulsions when a saint and a

goose mate with one another.
