Towards the throne they all strive: it is their madness—as if happiness

sat on the throne! Ofttimes sitteth filth on the throne.—and ofttimes

also the throne on filth.



Madmen they all seem to me, and clambering apes, and too eager. Badly

smelleth their idol to me, the cold monster: badly they all smell to me,

these idolaters.



My brethren, will ye suffocate in the fumes of their maws and appetites!

Better break the windows and jump into the open air!



Do go out of the way of the bad odour! Withdraw from the idolatry of the

superfluous!



Do go out of the way of the bad odour! Withdraw from the steam of these

human sacrifices!



Open still remaineth the earth for great souls. Empty are still many

sites for lone ones and twain ones, around which floateth the odour of

tranquil seas.



Open still remaineth a free life for great souls. Verily, he who

possesseth little is so much the less possessed: blessed be moderate

poverty!



There, where the state ceaseth—there only commenceth the man who is not

superfluous: there commenceth the song of the necessary ones, the single

and irreplaceable melody.



There, where the state CEASETH—pray look thither, my brethren! Do ye

not see it, the rainbow and the bridges of the Superman?—



Thus spake Zarathustra.
