More dangerous have I found it among men than among animals; in

dangerous paths goeth Zarathustra. Let mine animals lead me!”



When Zarathustra had said this, he remembered the words of the saint in

the forest. Then he sighed and spake thus to his heart:



“Would that I were wiser! Would that I were wise from the very heart,

like my serpent!



But I am asking the impossible. Therefore do I ask my pride to go always

with my wisdom!



And if my wisdom should some day forsake me:—alas! it loveth to fly

away!—may my pride then fly with my folly!”



Thus began Zarathustra’s down-going.









ZARATHUSTRA’S DISCOURSES.









I. THE THREE METAMORPHOSES.





Three metamorphoses of the spirit do I designate to you: how the spirit

becometh a camel, the camel a lion, and the lion at last a child.



Many heavy things are there for the spirit, the strong load-bearing

spirit in which reverence dwelleth: for the heavy and the heaviest

longeth its strength.



What is heavy? so asketh the load-bearing spirit; then kneeleth it down

like the camel, and wanteth to be well laden.



What is the heaviest thing, ye heroes? asketh the load-bearing spirit,

that I may take it upon me and rejoice in my strength.
