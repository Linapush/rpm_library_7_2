I am Zarathustra the godless! I cook every chance in MY pot. And only

when it hath been quite cooked do I welcome it as MY food.



And verily, many a chance came imperiously unto me: but still more

imperiously did my WILL speak unto it,—then did it lie imploringly upon

its knees—



—Imploring that it might find home and heart with me, and saying

flatteringly: “See, O Zarathustra, how friend only cometh unto

friend!”—



But why talk I, when no one hath MINE ears! And so will I shout it out

unto all the winds:



Ye ever become smaller, ye small people! Ye crumble away, ye comfortable

ones! Ye will yet perish—



—By your many small virtues, by your many small omissions, and by your

many small submissions!



Too tender, too yielding: so is your soil! But for a tree to become

GREAT, it seeketh to twine hard roots around hard rocks!



Also what ye omit weaveth at the web of all the human future; even your

naught is a cobweb, and a spider that liveth on the blood of the future.



And when ye take, then is it like stealing, ye small virtuous ones;

but even among knaves HONOUR saith that “one shall only steal when one

cannot rob.”



“It giveth itself”—that is also a doctrine of submission. But I say

unto you, ye comfortable ones, that IT TAKETH TO ITSELF, and will ever

take more and more from you!



Ah, that ye would renounce all HALF-willing, and would decide for

idleness as ye decide for action!



Ah, that ye understood my word: “Do ever what ye will—but first be such

as CAN WILL.
