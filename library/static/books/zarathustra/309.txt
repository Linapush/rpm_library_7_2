sand-grain considerateness, the ant-hill trumpery, the pitiable

comfortableness, the “happiness of the greatest number”—!



And rather despair than submit yourselves. And verily, I love you,

because ye know not to-day how to live, ye higher men! For thus do YE

live—best!

Have ye courage, O my brethren? Are ye stout-hearted? NOT the courage

before witnesses, but anchorite and eagle courage, which not even a God

any longer beholdeth?



Cold souls, mules, the blind and the drunken, I do not call

stout-hearted. He hath heart who knoweth fear, but VANQUISHETH it; who

seeth the abyss, but with PRIDE.



He who seeth the abyss, but with eagle’s eyes,—he who with eagle’s

talons GRASPETH the abyss: he hath courage.—

“Man is evil”—so said to me for consolation, all the wisest ones. Ah,

if only it be still true to-day! For the evil is man’s best force.



“Man must become better and eviler”—so do _I_ teach. The evilest is

necessary for the Superman’s best.



It may have been well for the preacher of the petty people to suffer and

be burdened by men’s sin. I, however, rejoice in great sin as my great

CONSOLATION.—



Such things, however, are not said for long ears. Every word, also,

is not suited for every mouth. These are fine far-away things: at them

sheep’s claws shall not grasp!



6.



Ye higher men, think ye that I am here to put right what ye have put

wrong?
