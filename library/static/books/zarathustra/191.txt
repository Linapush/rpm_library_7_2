There do I laugh at my stern guest, and am still fond of him; because he

cleareth my house of flies, and quieteth many little noises.



For he suffereth it not if a gnat wanteth to buzz, or even two of them;

also the lanes maketh he lonesome, so that the moonlight is afraid there

at night.



A hard guest is he,—but I honour him, and do not worship, like the

tenderlings, the pot-bellied fire-idol.



Better even a little teeth-chattering than idol-adoration!—so willeth

my nature. And especially have I a grudge against all ardent, steaming,

steamy fire-idols.



Him whom I love, I love better in winter than in summer; better do I

now mock at mine enemies, and more heartily, when winter sitteth in my

house.



Heartily, verily, even when I CREEP into bed—: there, still laugheth

and wantoneth my hidden happiness; even my deceptive dream laugheth.



I, a—creeper? Never in my life did I creep before the powerful; and if

ever I lied, then did I lie out of love. Therefore am I glad even in my

winter-bed.



A poor bed warmeth me more than a rich one, for I am jealous of my

poverty. And in winter she is most faithful unto me.



With a wickedness do I begin every day: I mock at the winter with a cold

bath: on that account grumbleth my stern house-mate.



Also do I like to tickle him with a wax-taper, that he may finally let

the heavens emerge from ashy-grey twilight.



For especially wicked am I in the morning: at the early hour when the

pail rattleth at the well, and horses neigh warmly in grey lanes:—



Impatiently do I then wait, that the clear sky may finally dawn for me,

the snow-bearded winter-sky, the hoary one, the whitehead,—
