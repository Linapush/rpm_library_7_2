One thirsteth for her and is not satisfied, one looketh through veils,

one graspeth through nets.



Is she beautiful? What do I know! But the oldest carps are still lured

by her.



Changeable is she, and wayward; often have I seen her bite her lip, and

pass the comb against the grain of her hair.



Perhaps she is wicked and false, and altogether a woman; but when she

speaketh ill of herself, just then doth she seduce most.”



When I had said this unto Life, then laughed she maliciously, and shut

her eyes. “Of whom dost thou speak?” said she. “Perhaps of me?



And if thou wert right—is it proper to say THAT in such wise to my

face! But now, pray, speak also of thy Wisdom!”



Ah, and now hast thou again opened thine eyes, O beloved Life! And into

the unfathomable have I again seemed to sink.—



Thus sang Zarathustra. But when the dance was over and the maidens had

departed, he became sad.



“The sun hath been long set,” said he at last, “the meadow is damp, and

from the forest cometh coolness.



An unknown presence is about me, and gazeth thoughtfully. What! Thou

livest still, Zarathustra?



Why? Wherefore? Whereby? Whither? Where? How? Is it not folly still to

live?—



Ah, my friends; the evening is it which thus interrogateth in me.

Forgive me my sadness!



Evening hath come on: forgive me that evening hath come on!”



Thus sang Zarathustra.
