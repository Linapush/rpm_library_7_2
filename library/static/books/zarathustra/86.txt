And out of reverence for the goal and the heir, he will hang up no more

withered wreaths in the sanctuary of life.



Verily, not the rope-makers will I resemble: they lengthen out their

cord, and thereby go ever backward.



Many a one, also, waxeth too old for his truths and triumphs; a

toothless mouth hath no longer the right to every truth.



And whoever wanteth to have fame, must take leave of honour betimes, and

practise the difficult art of—going at the right time.



One must discontinue being feasted upon when one tasteth best: that is

known by those who want to be long loved.



Sour apples are there, no doubt, whose lot is to wait until the last

day of autumn: and at the same time they become ripe, yellow, and

shrivelled.



In some ageth the heart first, and in others the spirit. And some are

hoary in youth, but the late young keep long young.



To many men life is a failure; a poison-worm gnaweth at their heart.

Then let them see to it that their dying is all the more a success.



Many never become sweet; they rot even in the summer. It is cowardice

that holdeth them fast to their branches.



Far too many live, and far too long hang they on their branches. Would

that a storm came and shook all this rottenness and worm-eatenness from

the tree!



Would that there came preachers of SPEEDY death! Those would be the

appropriate storms and agitators of the trees of life! But I hear only

slow death preached, and patience with all that is “earthly.”



Ah! ye preach patience with what is earthly? This earthly is it that

hath too much patience with you, ye blasphemers!
