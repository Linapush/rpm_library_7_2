XXI. VOLUNTARY DEATH.





Many die too late, and some die too early. Yet strange soundeth the

precept: “Die at the right time!”



Die at the right time: so teacheth Zarathustra.



To be sure, he who never liveth at the right time, how could he ever die

at the right time? Would that he might never be born!—Thus do I advise

the superfluous ones.



But even the superfluous ones make much ado about their death, and even

the hollowest nut wanteth to be cracked.



Every one regardeth dying as a great matter: but as yet death is not

a festival. Not yet have people learned to inaugurate the finest

festivals.



The consummating death I show unto you, which becometh a stimulus and

promise to the living.



His death, dieth the consummating one triumphantly, surrounded by hoping

and promising ones.



Thus should one learn to die; and there should be no festival at which

such a dying one doth not consecrate the oaths of the living!



Thus to die is best; the next best, however, is to die in battle, and

sacrifice a great soul.



But to the fighter equally hateful as to the victor, is your grinning

death which stealeth nigh like a thief,—and yet cometh as master.



My death, praise I unto you, the voluntary death, which cometh unto me

because _I_ want it.



And when shall I want it?—He that hath a goal and an heir, wanteth

death at the right time for the goal and the heir.
