and his guests: he pressed forward as one who had no time to lose,

seized Zarathustra’s hand and exclaimed: “But Zarathustra!



One thing is more necessary than the other, so sayest thou thyself:

well, one thing is now more necessary UNTO ME than all others.



A word at the right time: didst thou not invite me to TABLE? And here

are many who have made long journeys. Thou dost not mean to feed us

merely with discourses?



Besides, all of you have thought too much about freezing, drowning,

suffocating, and other bodily dangers: none of you, however, have

(Thus spake the soothsayer. When Zarathustra’s animals, however, heard

these words, they ran away in terror. For they saw that all they

had brought home during the day would not be enough to fill the one

water suit weary and withered ones: WE deserve wine—IT alone giveth

immediate vigour and improvised health!”



On this occasion, when the soothsayer was longing for wine, it happened

king on the right: we have enough of wine,—a whole ass-load of it. So

there is nothing lacking but bread.”



“Bread,” replied Zarathustra, laughing when he spake, “it is precisely

bread that anchorites have not. But man doth not live by bread alone,

but also by the flesh of good lambs, of which I have two:



—THESE shall we slaughter quickly, and cook spicily with sage: it is

so that I like them. And there is also no lack of roots and fruits,

good enough even for the fastidious and dainty,—nor of nuts and other
