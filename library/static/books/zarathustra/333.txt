which had hitherto been full of noise and laughter, became all at once

still as death;—his nose, however, smelt a sweet-scented vapour and

incense-odour, as if from burning pine-cones.



“What happeneth? What are they about?” he asked himself, and stole up

to the entrance, that he might be able unobserved to see his guests.

But wonder upon wonder! what was he then obliged to behold with his own

eyes!



“They have all of them become PIOUS again, they PRAY, they are

these higher men, the two kings, the pope out of service, the evil

magician, the voluntary beggar, the wanderer and shadow, the old

soothsayer, the spiritually conscientious one, and the ugliest man—they

all lay on their knees like children and credulous old women, and

worshipped the ass. And just then began the ugliest man to gurgle and

strange litany in praise of the adored and censed ass. And the litany

sounded thus:

be to our God, from everlasting to everlasting!



—The ass, however, here brayed YE-A.



He carrieth our burdens, he hath taken upon him the form of a servant,

he is patient of heart and never saith Nay; and he who loveth his God

chastiseth him.



—The ass, however, here brayed YE-A.



He speaketh not: except that he ever saith Yea to the world which

he created: thus doth he extol his world. It is his artfulness that

speaketh not: thus is he rarely found wrong.



—The ass, however, here brayed YE-A.



Uncomely goeth he through the world. Grey is the favourite colour in

which he wrappeth his virtue. Hath he spirit, then doth he conceal it;
