LXXVII. THE AWAKENING.





1.



After the song of the wanderer and shadow, the cave became all at once

full of noise and laughter: and since the assembled guests all spake

simultaneously, and even the ass, encouraged thereby, no longer

remained silent, a little aversion and scorn for his visitors came over

Zarathustra, although he rejoiced at their gladness. For it seemed to

him a sign of convalescence. So he slipped out into the open air and

spake to his animals.



“Whither hath their distress now gone?” said he, and already did he

himself feel relieved of his petty disgust—“with me, it seemeth that

they have unlearned their cries of distress!



—Though, alas! not yet their crying.” And Zarathustra stopped his

ears, for just then did the YE-A of the ass mix strangely with the noisy

jubilation of those higher men.



“They are merry,” he began again, “and who knoweth? perhaps at their

host’s expense; and if they have learned of me to laugh, still it is not

MY laughter they have learned.



But what matter about that! They are old people: they recover in their

own way, they laugh in their own way; mine ears have already endured

worse and have not become peevish.



This day is a victory: he already yieldeth, he fleeth, THE SPIRIT OF

GRAVITY, mine old arch-enemy! How well this day is about to end, which

began so badly and gloomily!



And it is ABOUT TO end. Already cometh the evening: over the sea

rideth it hither, the good rider! How it bobbeth, the blessed one, the

home-returning one, in its purple saddles!
