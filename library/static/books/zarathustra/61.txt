and short-sighted fall upon their knees!



Ah! even in your ears, ye great souls, it whispereth its gloomy lies!

Ah! it findeth out the rich hearts which willingly lavish themselves!



Yea, it findeth you out too, ye conquerors of the old God! Weary ye

became of the conflict, and now your weariness serveth the new idol!



Heroes and honourable ones, it would fain set up around it, the new

idol! Gladly it basketh in the sunshine of good consciences,—the cold

monster!



Everything will it give YOU, if YE worship it, the new idol: thus it

purchaseth the lustre of your virtue, and the glance of your proud eyes.



It seeketh to allure by means of you, the many-too-many! Yea, a hellish

artifice hath here been devised, a death-horse jingling with the

trappings of divine honours!



Yea, a dying for many hath here been devised, which glorifieth itself as

life: verily, a hearty service unto all preachers of death!



The state, I call it, where all are poison-drinkers, the good and the

bad: the state, where all lose themselves, the good and the bad: the

state, where the slow suicide of all—is called “life.”



Just see these superfluous ones! They steal the works of the inventors

and the treasures of the wise. Culture, they call their theft—and

everything becometh sickness and trouble unto them!



Just see these superfluous ones! Sick are they always; they vomit their

bile and call it a newspaper. They devour one another, and cannot even

digest themselves.



Just see these superfluous ones! Wealth they acquire and become poorer

thereby. Power they seek for, and above all, the lever of power, much

money—these impotent ones!



See them clamber, these nimble apes! They clamber over one another, and

thus scuffle into the mud and the abyss.
