hither-drawing, upward-drawing, upbringing; a drawer, a trainer, a

training-master, who not in vain counselled himself once on a time:

“Become what thou art!”



Thus may men now come UP to me; for as yet do I await the signs that it

is time for my down-going; as yet do I not myself go down, as I must do,

amongst men.



Therefore do I here wait, crafty and scornful upon high mountains,

How remote may such “remoteness” be? What doth it concern me? But on
