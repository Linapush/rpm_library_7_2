Ah! how ineptly cometh the word “virtue” out of their mouth! And when

they say: “I am just,” it always soundeth like: “I am just—revenged!”



With their virtues they want to scratch out the eyes of their enemies;

and they elevate themselves only that they may lower others.



And again there are those who sit in their swamp, and speak thus from

among the bulrushes: “Virtue—that is to sit quietly in the swamp.



We bite no one, and go out of the way of him who would bite; and in all

matters we have the opinion that is given us.”



And again there are those who love attitudes, and think that virtue is a

sort of attitude.



Their knees continually adore, and their hands are eulogies of virtue,

but their heart knoweth naught thereof.



And again there are those who regard it as virtue to say: “Virtue

is necessary”; but after all they believe only that policemen are

necessary.



And many a one who cannot see men’s loftiness, calleth it virtue to see

their baseness far too well: thus calleth he his evil eye virtue.—



And some want to be edified and raised up, and call it virtue: and

others want to be cast down,—and likewise call it virtue.



And thus do almost all think that they participate in virtue; and at

least every one claimeth to be an authority on “good” and “evil.”



But Zarathustra came not to say unto all those liars and fools: “What do

YE know of virtue! What COULD ye know of virtue!”—



But that ye, my friends, might become weary of the old words which ye

have learned from the fools and liars:



That ye might become weary of the words “reward,” “retribution,”

 “punishment,” “righteous vengeance.”—
