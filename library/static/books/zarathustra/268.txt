—“Whoever thou art,” said the trodden one, still enraged, “thou

treadest also too nigh me with thy parable, and not only with thy foot!



Lo! am I then a dog?”—And thereupon the sitting one got up, and pulled

his naked arm out of the swamp. For at first he had lain outstretched

on the ground, hidden and indiscernible, like those who lie in wait for

swamp-game.



“But whatever art thou about!” called out Zarathustra in alarm, for he

For the sake of the leech did I lie here by this swamp, like a fisher,

and already had mine outstretched arm been bitten ten times, when there

biteth a still finer leech at my blood, Zarathustra himself!



O happiness! O miracle! Praised be this day which enticed me into the
