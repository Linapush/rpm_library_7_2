Thus spake Zarathustra.









XXII. THE BESTOWING VIRTUE.





1.



When Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was

attached, the name of which is “The Pied Cow,” there followed him many

people who called themselves his disciples, and kept him company. Thus

came they to a crossroad. Then Zarathustra told them that he now wanted

to go alone; for he was fond of going alone. His disciples, however,

presented him at his departure with a staff, on the golden handle of

which a serpent twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account

of the staff, and supported himself thereon; then spake he thus to his

disciples:



Tell me, pray: how came gold to the highest value? Because it is

uncommon, and unprofiting, and beaming, and soft in lustre; it always

bestoweth itself.



Only as image of the highest virtue came gold to the highest value.

Goldlike, beameth the glance of the bestower. Gold-lustre maketh peace

between moon and sun.



Uncommon is the highest virtue, and unprofiting, beaming is it, and soft

of lustre: a bestowing virtue is the highest virtue.



Verily, I divine you well, my disciples: ye strive like me for the

bestowing virtue. What should ye have in common with cats and wolves?



It is your thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and

therefore have ye the thirst to accumulate all riches in your soul.



Insatiably striveth your soul for treasures and jewels, because your

virtue is insatiable in desiring to bestow.
