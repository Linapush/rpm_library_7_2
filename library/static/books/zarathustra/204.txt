being wanteth to become words, here all becoming wanteth to learn of me

how to talk.



Down there, however—all talking is in vain! There, forgetting and

passing-by are the best wisdom: THAT have I learned now!



He who would understand everything in man must handle everything. But

for that I have too clean hands.



I do not like even to inhale their breath; alas! that I have lived so

long among their noise and bad breaths!



O blessed stillness around me! O pure odours around me! How from a deep

breast this stillness fetcheth pure breath! How it hearkeneth, this

blessed stillness!



But down there—there speaketh everything, there is everything misheard.

If one announce one’s wisdom with bells, the shopmen in the market-place

will out-jingle it with pennies!



Everything among them talketh; no one knoweth any longer how to

understand. Everything falleth into the water; nothing falleth any

longer into deep wells.



Everything among them talketh, nothing succeedeth any longer and

accomplisheth itself. Everything cackleth, but who will still sit

quietly on the nest and hatch eggs?



Everything among them talketh, everything is out-talked. And that which

yesterday was still too hard for time itself and its tooth, hangeth

to-day, outchamped and outchewed, from the mouths of the men of to-day.



Everything among them talketh, everything is betrayed. And what was once

called the secret and secrecy of profound souls, belongeth to-day to the

street-trumpeters and other butterflies.



O human hubbub, thou wonderful thing! Thou noise in dark streets! Now

art thou again behind me:—my greatest danger lieth behind me!



In indulging and pitying lay ever my greatest danger; and all human
