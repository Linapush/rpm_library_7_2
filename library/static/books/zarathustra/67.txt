Do I counsel you to chastity? Chastity is a virtue with some, but with

many almost a vice.



These are continent, to be sure: but doggish lust looketh enviously out

of all that they do.



Even into the heights of their virtue and into their cold spirit doth

this creature follow them, with its discord.



And how nicely can doggish lust beg for a piece of spirit, when a piece

of flesh is denied it!



Ye love tragedies and all that breaketh the heart? But I am distrustful

of your doggish lust.



Ye have too cruel eyes, and ye look wantonly towards the sufferers.

Hath not your lust just disguised itself and taken the name of

fellow-suffering?



And also this parable give I unto you: Not a few who meant to cast out

their devil, went thereby into the swine themselves.



To whom chastity is difficult, it is to be dissuaded: lest it become the

road to hell—to filth and lust of soul.



Do I speak of filthy things? That is not the worst thing for me to do.



Not when the truth is filthy, but when it is shallow, doth the

discerning one go unwillingly into its waters.



Verily, there are chaste ones from their very nature; they are gentler

of heart, and laugh better and oftener than you.



They laugh also at chastity, and ask: “What is chastity?



Is chastity not folly? But the folly came unto us, and not we unto it.



We offered that guest harbour and heart: now it dwelleth with us—let it

stay as long as it will!”—
