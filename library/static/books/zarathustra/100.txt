If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is

preferably at a distance.



Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recognised:

and thus do I bid you do, my friends!



May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path, and

those with whom I MAY have hope and repast and honey in common!



Verily, I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something

better did I always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself

better.



Since humanity came into being, man hath enjoyed himself too little:

that alone, my brethren, is our original sin!



And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best to

give pain unto others, and to contrive pain.



Therefore do I wash the hand that hath helped the sufferer; therefore do

I wipe also my soul.



For in seeing the sufferer suffering—thereof was I ashamed on account

of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.



Great obligations do not make grateful, but revengeful; and when a small

kindness is not forgotten, it becometh a gnawing worm.



“Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!”—thus do I advise those

who have naught to bestow.



I, however, am a bestower: willingly do I bestow as friend to friends.

Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit

from my tree: thus doth it cause less shame.



Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! Verily, it annoyeth

one to give unto them, and it annoyeth one not to give unto them.



And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the

sting of conscience teacheth one to sting.
