‘WHERE is—MY home?’ For it do I ask and seek, and have sought, but

have not found it. O eternal everywhere, O eternal nowhere, O

eternal—in-vain!”



Thus spake the shadow, and Zarathustra’s countenance lengthened at his

words. “Thou art my shadow!” said he at last sadly.



“Thy danger is not small, thou free spirit and wanderer! Thou hast had a

bad day: see that a still worse evening doth not overtake thee!



To such unsettled ones as thou, seemeth at last even a prisoner blessed.

Didst thou ever see how captured criminals sleep? They sleep quietly,

they enjoy their new security.



Beware lest in the end a narrow faith capture thee, a hard, rigorous

delusion! For now everything that is narrow and fixed seduceth and

tempteth thee.



Thou hast lost thy goal. Alas, how wilt thou forego and forget that

loss? Thereby—hast thou also lost thy way!



Thou poor rover and rambler, thou tired butterfly! wilt thou have a rest

and a home this evening? Then go up to my cave!



Thither leadeth the way to my cave. And now will I run quickly away from

thee again. Already lieth as it were a shadow upon me.



I will run alone, so that it may again become bright around me.

Therefore must I still be a long time merrily upon my legs. In the

evening, however, there will be—dancing with me!”—



Thus spake Zarathustra.









LXX. NOONTIDE.
