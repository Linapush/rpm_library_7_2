but that the very form in which they are narrated is one which tends

rather to obscure than to throw light upon them, the difficulties which

meet the reader who starts quite unprepared will be seen to be really

formidable.



Zarathustra, then,—this shadowy, allegorical personality, speaking in

allegories and parables, and at times not even refraining from relating

his own dreams—is a figure we can understand but very imperfectly if we

have no knowledge of his creator and counterpart, Friedrich Nietzsche;

and it were therefore well, previous to our study of the more abstruse

parts of this book, if we were to turn to some authoritative book on

Nietzsche’s life and works and to read all that is there said on the

subject. Those who can read German will find an excellent guide, in this

respect, in Frau Foerster-Nietzsche’s exhaustive and highly interesting

biography of her brother: “Das Leben Friedrich Nietzsche’s” (published

by Naumann); while the works of Deussen, Raoul Richter, and Baroness

Isabelle von Unger-Sternberg, will be found to throw useful and

necessary light upon many questions which it would be difficult for a

sister to touch upon.



In regard to the actual philosophical views expounded in this work,

there is an excellent way of clearing up any difficulties they may

present, and that is by an appeal to Nietzsche’s other works. Again and

again, of course, he will be found to express himself so clearly that

all reference to his other writings may be dispensed with; but where

this is not the case, the advice he himself gives is after all the best

to be followed here, viz.:—to regard such works as: “Joyful Science”,

“Beyond Good and Evil”, “The Genealogy of Morals”, “The Twilight of

the Idols”, “The Antichrist”, “The Will to Power”, etc., etc., as the

necessary preparation for “Thus Spake Zarathustra”.



These directions, though they are by no means simple to carry out, seem

at least to possess the quality of definiteness and straightforwardness.

“Follow them and all will be clear,” I seem to imply. But I regret to

say that this is not really the case. For my experience tells me that

even after the above directions have been followed with the greatest

possible zeal, the student will still halt in perplexity before certain

passages in the book before us, and wonder what they mean. Now, it is

with the view of giving a little additional help to all those who find

themselves in this position that I proceed to put forth my own personal
