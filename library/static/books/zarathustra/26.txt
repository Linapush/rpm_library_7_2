5.



When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he again looked at the people,

and was silent. “There they stand,” said he to his heart; “there they

laugh: they understand me not; I am not the mouth for these ears.



Must one first batter their ears, that they may learn to hear with their

eyes? Must one clatter like kettledrums and penitential preachers? Or do

they only believe the stammerer?



They have something whereof they are proud. What do they call it, that

which maketh them proud? Culture, they call it; it distinguisheth them

from the goatherds.



They dislike, therefore, to hear of ‘contempt’ of themselves. So I will

appeal to their pride.



I will speak unto them of the most contemptible thing: that, however, is

THE LAST MAN!”



And thus spake Zarathustra unto the people:



It is time for man to fix his goal. It is time for man to plant the germ

of his highest hope.



Still is his soil rich enough for it. But that soil will one day be

poor and exhausted, and no lofty tree will any longer be able to grow

thereon.



Alas! there cometh the time when man will no longer launch the arrow of

his longing beyond man—and the string of his bow will have unlearned to

whizz!



I tell you: one must still have chaos in one, to give birth to a dancing

star. I tell you: ye have still chaos in you.



Alas! There cometh the time when man will no longer give birth to any

star. Alas! There cometh the time of the most despicable man, who can no

longer despise himself.
