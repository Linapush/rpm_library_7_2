—Which hath already counted the smarting throbbings of your fathers’

hearts—ah! ah! how it sigheth! how it laugheth in its dream! the old,

deep, deep midnight!



Hush! Hush! Then is there many a thing heard which may not be heard

by day; now however, in the cool air, when even all the tumult of your

hearts hath become still,—



—Now doth it speak, now is it heard, now doth it steal into

overwakeful, nocturnal souls: ah! ah! how the midnight sigheth! how it

laugheth in its dream!



—Hearest thou not how it mysteriously, frightfully, and cordially

speaketh unto THEE, the old deep, deep midnight?



O MAN, TAKE HEED!

Woe to me! Whither hath time gone? Have I not sunk into deep wells? The

world sleepeth—



Ah! Ah! The dog howleth, the moon shineth. Rather will I die, rather

will I die, than say unto you what my midnight-heart now thinketh.



Already have I died. It is all over. Spider, why spinnest thou around

me? Wilt thou have blood? Ah! Ah! The dew falleth, the hour cometh—



—The hour in which I frost and freeze, which asketh and asketh and

asketh: “Who hath sufficient courage for it?



—Who is to be master of the world? Who is going to say: THUS shall ye

flow, ye great and small streams!”



—The hour approacheth: O man, thou higher man, take heed! this talk is

for fine ears, for thine ears—WHAT SAITH DEEP MIDNIGHT’S VOICE INDEED?
