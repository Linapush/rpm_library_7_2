your counterpart. And I am also your best enemy. So let me tell you the

truth!



I know the hatred and envy of your hearts. Ye are not great enough not

to know of hatred and envy. Then be great enough not to be ashamed of

them!



And if ye cannot be saints of knowledge, then, I pray you, be at least

its warriors. They are the companions and forerunners of such saintship.



I see many soldiers; could I but see many warriors! “Uniform” one

calleth what they wear; may it not be uniform what they therewith hide!



Ye shall be those whose eyes ever seek for an enemy—for YOUR enemy. And

with some of you there is hatred at first sight.



Your enemy shall ye seek; your war shall ye wage, and for the sake of

your thoughts! And if your thoughts succumb, your uprightness shall

still shout triumph thereby!



Ye shall love peace as a means to new wars—and the short peace more

than the long.



You I advise not to work, but to fight. You I advise not to peace, but

to victory. Let your work be a fight, let your peace be a victory!



One can only be silent and sit peacefully when one hath arrow and bow;

otherwise one prateth and quarrelleth. Let your peace be a victory!



Ye say it is the good cause which halloweth even war? I say unto you: it

is the good war which halloweth every cause.



War and courage have done more great things than charity. Not your

sympathy, but your bravery hath hitherto saved the victims.



“What is good?” ye ask. To be brave is good. Let the little girls say:

“To be good is what is pretty, and at the same time touching.”



They call you heartless: but your heart is true, and I love the

bashfulness of your good-will. Ye are ashamed of your flow, and others
