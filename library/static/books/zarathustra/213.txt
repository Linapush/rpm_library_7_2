love oneself. Rather is it of all arts the finest, subtlest, last and

patientest.



For to its possessor is all possession well concealed, and of all

treasure-pits one’s own is last excavated—so causeth the spirit of

gravity.



Almost in the cradle are we apportioned with heavy words and worths:

“good” and “evil”—so calleth itself this dowry. For the sake of it we

are forgiven for living.



And therefore suffereth one little children to come unto one, to forbid

them betimes to love themselves—so causeth the spirit of gravity.



And we—we bear loyally what is apportioned unto us, on hard shoulders,

over rugged mountains! And when we sweat, then do people say to us:

“Yea, life is hard to bear!”



But man himself only is hard to bear! The reason thereof is that he

carrieth too many extraneous things on his shoulders. Like the camel

kneeleth he down, and letteth himself be well laden.



Especially the strong load-bearing man in whom reverence resideth. Too

many EXTRANEOUS heavy words and worths loadeth he upon himself—then

seemeth life to him a desert!



And verily! Many a thing also that is OUR OWN is hard to bear! And many

internal things in man are like the oyster—repulsive and slippery and

hard to grasp;—



So that an elegant shell, with elegant adornment, must plead for

them. But this art also must one learn: to HAVE a shell, and a fine

appearance, and sagacious blindness!



Again, it deceiveth about many things in man, that many a shell is poor

and pitiable, and too much of a shell. Much concealed goodness and power

is never dreamt of; the choicest dainties find no tasters!



Women know that, the choicest of them: a little fatter a little leaner—

oh, how much fate is in so little!
