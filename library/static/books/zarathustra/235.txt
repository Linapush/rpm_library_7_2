But he who discovered the country of “man,” discovered also the country

of “man’s future.” Now shall ye be sailors for me, brave, patient!



Keep yourselves up betimes, my brethren, learn to keep yourselves up!

The sea stormeth: many seek to raise themselves again by you.



The sea stormeth: all is in the sea. Well! Cheer up! Ye old

seaman-hearts!



What of fatherland! THITHER striveth our helm where our CHILDREN’S LAND

is! Thitherwards, stormier than the sea, stormeth our great longing!—

“Why so hard!”—said to the diamond one day the charcoal; “are we then

not near relatives?”—



Why so soft? O my brethren; thus do _I_ ask you: are ye then not—my

brethren?



Why so soft, so submissive and yielding? Why is there so much negation

and abnegation in your hearts? Why is there so little fate in your

looks?



And if ye will not be fates and inexorable ones, how can ye one day—

conquer with me?



And if your hardness will not glance and cut and chip to pieces, how can

ye one day—create with me?



For the creators are hard. And blessedness must it seem to you to press

your hand upon millenniums as upon wax,—



—Blessedness to write upon the will of millenniums as upon

brass,—harder than brass, nobler than brass. Entirely hard is only the

noblest.



This new table, O my brethren, put I up over you: BECOME HARD!—
