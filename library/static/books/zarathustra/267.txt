himself. “Well!” said he, “thither leadeth the way, there lieth the

cave of Zarathustra; and this day is to have a long evening! At present,

however, a cry of distress calleth me hastily away from you.



It will honour my cave if kings want to sit and wait in it: but, to be

sure, ye will have to wait long!



Well! What of that! Where doth one at present learn better to wait

than at courts? And the whole virtue of kings that hath remained unto

them—is it not called to-day: ABILITY to wait?”



Thus spake Zarathustra.









LXIV. THE LEECH.





And Zarathustra went thoughtfully on, further and lower down, through

forests and past moory bottoms; as it happeneth, however, to every one

who meditateth upon hard matters, he trod thereby unawares upon a man.

And lo, there spurted into his face all at once a cry of pain, and two

curses and twenty bad invectives, so that in his fright he raised his

stick and also struck the trodden one. Immediately afterwards, however,

he regained his composure, and his heart laughed at the folly he had

just committed.



“Pardon me,” said he to the trodden one, who had got up enraged, and had

seated himself, “pardon me, and hear first of all a parable.



As a wanderer who dreameth of remote things on a lonesome highway,

runneth unawares against a sleeping dog, a dog which lieth in the sun:



—As both of them then start up and snap at each other, like deadly

enemies, those two beings mortally frightened—so did it happen unto us.



And yet! And yet—how little was lacking for them to caress each other,

that dog and that lonesome one! Are they not both—lonesome ones!”
