one relapse again into his low estate!



There is no salvation for him who thus suffereth from himself, unless it

be speedy death.



Your slaying, ye judges, shall be pity, and not revenge; and in that ye

slay, see to it that ye yourselves justify life!



It is not enough that ye should reconcile with him whom ye slay. Let

your sorrow be love to the Superman: thus will ye justify your own

survival!



“Enemy” shall ye say but not “villain,” “invalid” shall ye say but not

“wretch,” “fool” shall ye say but not “sinner.”



And thou, red judge, if thou would say audibly all thou hast done in

thought, then would every one cry: “Away with the nastiness and the

virulent reptile!”



But one thing is the thought, another thing is the deed, and another

thing is the idea of the deed. The wheel of causality doth not roll

between them.



An idea made this pale man pale. Adequate was he for his deed when he

did it, but the idea of it, he could not endure when it was done.



Evermore did he now see himself as the doer of one deed. Madness, I call

this: the exception reversed itself to the rule in him.



The streak of chalk bewitcheth the hen; the stroke he struck bewitched

his weak reason. Madness AFTER the deed, I call this.



Hearken, ye judges! There is another madness besides, and it is BEFORE

the deed. Ah! ye have not gone deep enough into this soul!



Thus speaketh the red judge: “Why did this criminal commit murder? He

meant to rob.” I tell you, however, that his soul wanted blood, not

booty: he thirsted for the happiness of the knife!



But his weak reason understood not this madness, and it persuaded him.
