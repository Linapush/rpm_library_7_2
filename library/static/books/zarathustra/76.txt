Canst thou give unto thyself thy bad and thy good, and set up thy will

as a law over thee? Canst thou be judge for thyself, and avenger of thy

law?



Terrible is aloneness with the judge and avenger of one’s own law.

Thus is a star projected into desert space, and into the icy breath of

aloneness.



To-day sufferest thou still from the multitude, thou individual; to-day

hast thou still thy courage unabated, and thy hopes.



But one day will the solitude weary thee; one day will thy pride yield,

and thy courage quail. Thou wilt one day cry: “I am alone!”



One day wilt thou see no longer thy loftiness, and see too closely thy

lowliness; thy sublimity itself will frighten thee as a phantom. Thou

wilt one day cry: “All is false!”



There are feelings which seek to slay the lonesome one; if they do not

succeed, then must they themselves die! But art thou capable of it—to

be a murderer?



Hast thou ever known, my brother, the word “disdain”? And the anguish of

thy justice in being just to those that disdain thee?



Thou forcest many to think differently about thee; that, charge they

heavily to thine account. Thou camest nigh unto them, and yet wentest

past: for that they never forgive thee.



Thou goest beyond them: but the higher thou risest, the smaller doth the

eye of envy see thee. Most of all, however, is the flying one hated.



“How could ye be just unto me!”—must thou say—“I choose your injustice

as my allotted portion.”



Injustice and filth cast they at the lonesome one: but, my brother, if

thou wouldst be a star, thou must shine for them none the less on that

account!



And be on thy guard against the good and just! They would fain crucify
