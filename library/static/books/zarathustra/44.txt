What the sense feeleth, what the spirit discerneth, hath never its end

in itself. But sense and spirit would fain persuade thee that they are

the end of all things: so vain are they.



Instruments and playthings are sense and spirit: behind them there

is still the Self. The Self seeketh with the eyes of the senses, it

hearkeneth also with the ears of the spirit.



Ever hearkeneth the Self, and seeketh; it compareth, mastereth,

conquereth, and destroyeth. It ruleth, and is also the ego’s ruler.



Behind thy thoughts and feelings, my brother, there is a mighty lord,

an unknown sage—it is called Self; it dwelleth in thy body, it is thy

body.



There is more sagacity in thy body than in thy best wisdom. And who then

knoweth why thy body requireth just thy best wisdom?



Thy Self laugheth at thine ego, and its proud prancings. “What are these

prancings and flights of thought unto me?” it saith to itself. “A by-way

to my purpose. I am the leading-string of the ego, and the prompter of

its notions.”



The Self saith unto the ego: “Feel pain!” And thereupon it suffereth,

and thinketh how it may put an end thereto—and for that very purpose it

IS MEANT to think.



The Self saith unto the ego: “Feel pleasure!” Thereupon it rejoiceth,

and thinketh how it may ofttimes rejoice—and for that very purpose it

IS MEANT to think.



To the despisers of the body will I speak a word. That they despise is

caused by their esteem. What is it that created esteeming and despising

and worth and will?



The creating Self created for itself esteeming and despising, it created

for itself joy and woe. The creating body created for itself spirit, as

a hand to its will.
