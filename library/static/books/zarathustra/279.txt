Now, however, am I out of service, without master, and yet not free;

likewise am I no longer merry even for an hour, except it be in

recollections.



Therefore did I ascend into these mountains, that I might finally have

a festival for myself once more, as becometh an old pope and

church-father: for know it, that I am the last pope!—a festival of

pious recollections and divine services.



Now, however, is he himself dead, the most pious of men, the saint in

the forest, who praised his God constantly with singing and mumbling.



He himself found I no longer when I found his cot—but two wolves found

I therein, which howled on account of his death,—for all animals loved

him. Then did I haste away.



Had I thus come in vain into these forests and mountains? Then did my

heart determine that I should seek another, the most pious of all

those who believe not in God—, my heart determined that I should seek

Zarathustra!”



Thus spake the hoary man, and gazed with keen eyes at him who stood

before him. Zarathustra however seized the hand of the old pope and

regarded it a long while with admiration.



“Lo! thou venerable one,” said he then, “what a fine and long hand! That

is the hand of one who hath ever dispensed blessings. Now, however, doth

it hold fast him whom thou seekest, me, Zarathustra.



It is I, the ungodly Zarathustra, who saith: ‘Who is ungodlier than I,

that I may enjoy his teaching?’”—



Thus spake Zarathustra, and penetrated with his glances the thoughts and

arrear-thoughts of the old pope. At last the latter began:



“He who most loved and possessed him hath now also lost him most—:



—Lo, I myself am surely the most godless of us at present? But who

could rejoice at that!”—
