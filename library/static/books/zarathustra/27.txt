Lo! I show you THE LAST MAN.



“What is love? What is creation? What is longing? What is a star?”—so

asketh the last man and blinketh.



The earth hath then become small, and on it there hoppeth the last man

who maketh everything small. His species is ineradicable like that of

the ground-flea; the last man liveth longest.



“We have discovered happiness”—say the last men, and blink thereby.



They have left the regions where it is hard to live; for they need

warmth. One still loveth one’s neighbour and rubbeth against him; for

one needeth warmth.



Turning ill and being distrustful, they consider sinful: they walk

warily. He is a fool who still stumbleth over stones or men!



A little poison now and then: that maketh pleasant dreams. And much

poison at last for a pleasant death.



One still worketh, for work is a pastime. But one is careful lest the

pastime should hurt one.



One no longer becometh poor or rich; both are too burdensome. Who still

wanteth to rule? Who still wanteth to obey? Both are too burdensome.



No shepherd, and one herd! Every one wanteth the same; every one is

equal: he who hath other sentiments goeth voluntarily into the madhouse.



“Formerly all the world was insane,”—say the subtlest of them, and

blink thereby.



They are clever and know all that hath happened: so there is

no end to their raillery. People still fall out, but are soon

reconciled—otherwise it spoileth their stomachs.



They have their little pleasures for the day, and their little pleasures

for the night, but they have a regard for health.
