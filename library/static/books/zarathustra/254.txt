If the exploring delight be in me, which impelleth sails to the

undiscovered, if the seafarer’s delight be in my delight:



If ever my rejoicing hath called out: “The shore hath vanished,—now

hath fallen from me the last chain—



The boundless roareth around me, far away sparkle for me space and

time,—well! cheer up! old heart!”—



Oh, how could I not be ardent for Eternity, and for the marriage-ring of

rings—the ring of the return?



Never yet have I found the woman by whom I should like to have children,

unless it be this woman whom I love: for I love thee, O Eternity!



FOR I LOVE THEE, O ETERNITY!



6.



If my virtue be a dancer’s virtue, and if I have often sprung with both

feet into golden-emerald rapture:



If my wickedness be a laughing wickedness, at home among rose-banks and

hedges of lilies:



—For in laughter is all evil present, but it is sanctified and absolved

by its own bliss:—



And if it be my Alpha and Omega that everything heavy shall become

light, every body a dancer, and every spirit a bird: and verily, that is

my Alpha and Omega!—



Oh, how could I not be ardent for Eternity, and for the marriage-ring of

rings—the ring of the return?



Never yet have I found the woman by whom I should like to have children,

unless it be this woman whom I love: for I love thee, O Eternity!



FOR I LOVE THEE, O ETERNITY!
