But he meaneth ‘blunt language and bluntly’—well! That is not the worst

taste in these days!”)



“Ye may, verily, all of you be higher men,” continued Zarathustra; “but

for me—ye are neither high enough, nor strong enough.



For me, that is to say, for the inexorable which is now silent in me,

but will not always be silent. And if ye appertain to me, still it is

not as my right arm.



For he who himself standeth, like you, on sickly and tender legs,

wisheth above all to be TREATED INDULGENTLY, whether he be conscious of

it or hide it from himself.



My arms and my legs, however, I do not treat indulgently, I DO NOT TREAT

MY WARRIORS INDULGENTLY: how then could ye be fit for MY warfare?



With you I should spoil all my victories. And many of you would tumble

over if ye but heard the loud beating of my drums.



Moreover, ye are not sufficiently beautiful and well-born for me. I

require pure, smooth mirrors for my doctrines; on your surface even mine

own likeness is distorted.



On your shoulders presseth many a burden, many a recollection; many a

mischievous dwarf squatteth in your corners. There is concealed populace

also in you.



And though ye be high and of a higher type, much in you is crooked and

misshapen. There is no smith in the world that could hammer you right

and straight for me.



Ye are only bridges: may higher ones pass over upon you! Ye signify

steps: so do not upbraid him who ascendeth beyond you into HIS height!



Out of your seed there may one day arise for me a genuine son and

perfect heir: but that time is distant. Ye yourselves are not those unto

whom my heritage and name belong.
