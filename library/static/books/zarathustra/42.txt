A new will teach I unto men: to choose that path which man hath followed

blindly, and to approve of it—and no longer to slink aside from it,

like the sick and perishing!



The sick and perishing—it was they who despised the body and the earth,

and invented the heavenly world, and the redeeming blood-drops; but even

those sweet and sad poisons they borrowed from the body and the earth!



From their misery they sought escape, and the stars were too remote for

them. Then they sighed: “O that there were heavenly paths by which to

steal into another existence and into happiness!” Then they contrived

for themselves their by-paths and bloody draughts!



Beyond the sphere of their body and this earth they now fancied

themselves transported, these ungrateful ones. But to what did they owe

the convulsion and rapture of their transport? To their body and this

earth.



Gentle is Zarathustra to the sickly. Verily, he is not indignant

at their modes of consolation and ingratitude. May they become

convalescents and overcomers, and create higher bodies for themselves!



Neither is Zarathustra indignant at a convalescent who looketh tenderly

on his delusions, and at midnight stealeth round the grave of his God;

but sickness and a sick frame remain even in his tears.



Many sickly ones have there always been among those who muse, and

languish for God; violently they hate the discerning ones, and the

latest of virtues, which is uprightness.



Backward they always gaze toward dark ages: then, indeed, were delusion

and faith something different. Raving of the reason was likeness to God,

and doubt was sin.



Too well do I know those godlike ones: they insist on being believed in,

and that doubt is sin. Too well, also, do I know what they themselves

most believe in.



Verily, not in backworlds and redeeming blood-drops: but in the body

do they also believe most; and their own body is for them the
