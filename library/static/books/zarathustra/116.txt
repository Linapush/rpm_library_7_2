That I may NOT turn dizzy, however, bind me fast, my friends, to this

pillar! Rather will I be a pillar-saint than a whirl of vengeance!



Verily, no cyclone or whirlwind is Zarathustra: and if he be a dancer,

he is not at all a tarantula-dancer!—



Thus spake Zarathustra.









XXX. THE FAMOUS WISE ONES.





The people have ye served and the people’s superstition—NOT the

truth!—all ye famous wise ones! And just on that account did they pay

you reverence.



And on that account also did they tolerate your unbelief, because it

was a pleasantry and a by-path for the people. Thus doth the master give

free scope to his slaves, and even enjoyeth their presumptuousness.



But he who is hated by the people, as the wolf by the dogs—is the free

spirit, the enemy of fetters, the non-adorer, the dweller in the woods.



To hunt him out of his lair—that was always called “sense of right” by

the people: on him do they still hound their sharpest-toothed dogs.



“For there the truth is, where the people are! Woe, woe to the seeking

ones!”—thus hath it echoed through all time.



Your people would ye justify in their reverence: that called ye “Will to

Truth,” ye famous wise ones!



And your heart hath always said to itself: “From the people have I come:

from thence came to me also the voice of God.”



Stiff-necked and artful, like the ass, have ye always been, as the

advocates of the people.
