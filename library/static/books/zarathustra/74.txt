so, he who speaketh contrary to his ignorance. And thus speak ye

of yourselves in your intercourse, and belie your neighbour with

yourselves.



Thus saith the fool: “Association with men spoileth the character,

especially when one hath none.”



The one goeth to his neighbour because he seeketh himself, and the other

because he would fain lose himself. Your bad love to yourselves maketh

solitude a prison to you.



The furthest ones are they who pay for your love to the near ones; and

when there are but five of you together, a sixth must always die.



I love not your festivals either: too many actors found I there, and

even the spectators often behaved like actors.



Not the neighbour do I teach you, but the friend. Let the friend be the

festival of the earth to you, and a foretaste of the Superman.



I teach you the friend and his overflowing heart. But one must know how

to be a sponge, if one would be loved by overflowing hearts.



I teach you the friend in whom the world standeth complete, a capsule

of the good,—the creating friend, who hath always a complete world to

bestow.



And as the world unrolled itself for him, so rolleth it together again

for him in rings, as the growth of good through evil, as the growth of

purpose out of chance.



Let the future and the furthest be the motive of thy to-day; in thy

friend shalt thou love the Superman as thy motive.



My brethren, I advise you not to neighbour-love—I advise you to

furthest love!—



Thus spake Zarathustra.
