Flee, my friend, into thy solitude! I see thee deafened with the noise

of the great men, and stung all over with the stings of the little ones.



Admirably do forest and rock know how to be silent with thee. Resemble

again the tree which thou lovest, the broad-branched one—silently and

attentively it o’erhangeth the sea.



Where solitude endeth, there beginneth the market-place; and where the

market-place beginneth, there beginneth also the noise of the great

actors, and the buzzing of the poison-flies.



In the world even the best things are worthless without those who

represent them: those representers, the people call great men.



Little do the people understand what is great—that is to say, the

creating agency. But they have a taste for all representers and actors

of great things.



Around the devisers of new values revolveth the world:—invisibly it

revolveth. But around the actors revolve the people and the glory: such

is the course of things.



Spirit, hath the actor, but little conscience of the spirit. He

believeth always in that wherewith he maketh believe most strongly—in

HIMSELF!



To-morrow he hath a new belief, and the day after, one still newer. Sharp

perceptions hath he, like the people, and changeable humours.



To upset—that meaneth with him to prove. To drive mad—that meaneth

with him to convince. And blood is counted by him as the best of all

arguments.



A truth which only glideth into fine ears, he calleth falsehood and

trumpery. Verily, he believeth only in Gods that make a great noise in

the world!



Full of clattering buffoons is the market-place,—and the people glory

in their great men! These are for them the masters of the hour.
