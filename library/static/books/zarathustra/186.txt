They cough when I speak: they think coughing an objection to strong

winds—they divine nothing of the boisterousness of my happiness!



“We have not yet time for Zarathustra”—so they object; but what matter

about a time that “hath no time” for Zarathustra?



And if they should altogether praise me, how could I go to sleep on

THEIR praise? A girdle of spines is their praise unto me: it scratcheth

me even when I take it off.



And this also did I learn among them: the praiser doeth as if he gave

back; in truth, however, he wanteth more to be given him!



Ask my foot if their lauding and luring strains please it! Verily,

to such measure and ticktack, it liketh neither to dance nor to stand

still.



To small virtues would they fain lure and laud me; to the ticktack of

small happiness would they fain persuade my foot.



I pass through this people and keep mine eyes open; they have become

SMALLER, and ever become smaller:—THE REASON THEREOF IS THEIR DOCTRINE

OF HAPPINESS AND VIRTUE.



For they are moderate also in virtue,—because they want comfort. With

comfort, however, moderate virtue only is compatible.



To be sure, they also learn in their way to stride on and stride

forward: that, I call their HOBBLING.—Thereby they become a hindrance

to all who are in haste.



And many of them go forward, and look backwards thereby, with stiffened

necks: those do I like to run up against.



Foot and eye shall not lie, nor give the lie to each other. But there is

much lying among small people.



Some of them WILL, but most of them are WILLED. Some of them are

genuine, but most of them are bad actors.
