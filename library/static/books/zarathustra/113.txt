revengeful ones!



But I will soon bring your hiding-places to the light: therefore do I

laugh in your face my laughter of the height.



Therefore do I tear at your web, that your rage may lure you out of your

den of lies, and that your revenge may leap forth from behind your word

“justice.”



Because, FOR MAN TO BE REDEEMED FROM REVENGE—that is for me the bridge

to the highest hope, and a rainbow after long storms.



Otherwise, however, would the tarantulas have it. “Let it be

very justice for the world to become full of the storms of our

vengeance”—thus do they talk to one another.



“Vengeance will we use, and insult, against all who are not like

us”—thus do the tarantula-hearts pledge themselves.



“And ‘Will to Equality’—that itself shall henceforth be the name of

virtue; and against all that hath power will we raise an outcry!”



Ye preachers of equality, the tyrant-frenzy of impotence crieth thus in

you for “equality”: your most secret tyrant-longings disguise themselves

thus in virtue-words!



Fretted conceit and suppressed envy—perhaps your fathers’ conceit and

envy: in you break they forth as flame and frenzy of vengeance.



What the father hath hid cometh out in the son; and oft have I found in

the son the father’s revealed secret.



Inspired ones they resemble: but it is not the heart that inspireth

them—but vengeance. And when they become subtle and cold, it is not

spirit, but envy, that maketh them so.



Their jealousy leadeth them also into thinkers’ paths; and this is the

sign of their jealousy—they always go too far: so that their fatigue

hath at last to go to sleep on the snow.
