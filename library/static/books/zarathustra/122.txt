XXXII. THE DANCE-SONG.





One evening went Zarathustra and his disciples through the forest; and

when he sought for a well, lo, he lighted upon a green meadow peacefully

surrounded with trees and bushes, where maidens were dancing together.

As soon as the maidens recognised Zarathustra, they ceased dancing;

Zarathustra, however, approached them with friendly mien and spake these

words:



Cease not your dancing, ye lovely maidens! No game-spoiler hath come to

you with evil eye, no enemy of maidens.



God’s advocate am I with the devil: he, however, is the spirit of

gravity. How could I, ye light-footed ones, be hostile to divine dances?

Or to maidens’ feet with fine ankles?



To be sure, I am a forest, and a night of dark trees: but he who is not

afraid of my darkness, will find banks full of roses under my cypresses.



And even the little God may he find, who is dearest to maidens: beside

the well lieth he quietly, with closed eyes.



Verily, in broad daylight did he fall asleep, the sluggard! Had he

perhaps chased butterflies too much?



Upbraid me not, ye beautiful dancers, when I chasten the little God

somewhat! He will cry, certainly, and weep—but he is laughable even

when weeping!



And with tears in his eyes shall he ask you for a dance; and I myself

will sing a song to his dance:



A dance-song and satire on the spirit of gravity my supremest,

powerfulest devil, who is said to be “lord of the world.”—



And this is the song that Zarathustra sang when Cupid and the maidens

danced together:
