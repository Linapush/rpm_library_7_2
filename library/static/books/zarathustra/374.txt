to the Schopenhauerian Pessimism.



Pars. 14, 15, 16, 17.



These are supplementary to the discourse “Backworld’s-men”.



Par. 18.



We must be careful to separate this paragraph, in sense, from the

previous four paragraphs. Nietzsche is still dealing with Pessimism

here; but it is the pessimism of the hero—the man most susceptible of

all to desperate views of life, owing to the obstacles that are arrayed

against him in a world where men of his kind are very rare and are

continually being sacrificed. It was to save this man that Nietzsche

wrote. Heroism foiled, thwarted, and wrecked, hoping and fighting until

the last, is at length overtaken by despair, and renounces all struggle

for sleep. This is not the natural or constitutional pessimism which

proceeds from an unhealthy body—the dyspeptic’s lack of appetite; it

is rather the desperation of the netted lion that ultimately stops all

movement, because the more it moves the more involved it becomes.



Par. 20.



“All that increases power is good, all that springs from weakness is

bad. The weak and ill-constituted shall perish: first principle of our

charity. And one shall also help them thereto.” Nietzsche partly divined

the kind of reception moral values of this stamp would meet with at

the hands of the effeminate manhood of Europe. Here we see that he had

anticipated the most likely form their criticism would take (see also

the last two verses of par. 17).



Par. 21.



The first ten verses, here, are reminiscent of “War and Warriors” and

of “The Flies in the Market-place.” Verses 11 and 12, however, are

particularly important. There is a strong argument in favour of the

sharp differentiation of castes and of races (and even of sexes; see

Note on Chapter XVIII.) running all through Nietzsche’s writings.

But sharp differentiation also implies antagonism in some form or

other—hence Nietzsche’s fears for modern men. What modern men desire
