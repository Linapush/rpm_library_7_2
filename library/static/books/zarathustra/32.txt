and he shouted for joy: for he saw a new truth. And he spake thus to his

heart:



A light hath dawned upon me: I need companions—living ones; not dead

companions and corpses, which I carry with me where I will.



But I need living companions, who will follow me because they want to

follow themselves—and to the place where I will.



A light hath dawned upon me. Not to the people is Zarathustra to speak,

but to companions! Zarathustra shall not be the herd’s herdsman and

hound!



To allure many from the herd—for that purpose have I come. The people

and the herd must be angry with me: a robber shall Zarathustra be called

by the herdsmen.



Herdsmen, I say, but they call themselves the good and just. Herdsmen, I

say, but they call themselves the believers in the orthodox belief.



Behold the good and just! Whom do they hate most? Him who breaketh up

their tables of values, the breaker, the law-breaker:—he, however, is

the creator.



Behold the believers of all beliefs! Whom do they hate most? Him who

breaketh up their tables of values, the breaker, the law-breaker—he,

however, is the creator.



Companions, the creator seeketh, not corpses—and not herds or believers

either. Fellow-creators the creator seeketh—those who grave new values

on new tables.



Companions, the creator seeketh, and fellow-reapers: for everything is

ripe for the harvest with him. But he lacketh the hundred sickles: so he

plucketh the ears of corn and is vexed.



Companions, the creator seeketh, and such as know how to whet their

sickles. Destroyers, will they be called, and despisers of good and

evil. But they are the reapers and rejoicers.
