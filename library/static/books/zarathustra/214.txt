Man is difficult to discover, and unto himself most difficult of all;

often lieth the spirit concerning the soul. So causeth the spirit of

gravity.



He, however, hath discovered himself who saith: This is MY good and

evil: therewith hath he silenced the mole and the dwarf, who say: “Good

for all, evil for all.”



Verily, neither do I like those who call everything good, and this world

the best of all. Those do I call the all-satisfied.



All-satisfiedness, which knoweth how to taste everything,—that is

not the best taste! I honour the refractory, fastidious tongues and

stomachs, which have learned to say “I” and “Yea” and “Nay.”



To chew and digest everything, however—that is the genuine

swine-nature! Ever to say YE-A—that hath only the ass learnt, and those

like it!—



Deep yellow and hot red—so wanteth MY taste—it mixeth blood with all

colours. He, however, who whitewasheth his house, betrayeth unto me a

whitewashed soul.



With mummies, some fall in love; others with phantoms: both alike

hostile to all flesh and blood—oh, how repugnant are both to my taste!

For I love blood.



And there will I not reside and abide where every one spitteth and

speweth: that is now MY taste,—rather would I live amongst thieves and

perjurers. Nobody carrieth gold in his mouth.



Still more repugnant unto me, however, are all lickspittles; and the

most repugnant animal of man that I found, did I christen “parasite”: it

would not love, and would yet live by love.



Unhappy do I call all those who have only one choice: either to become

evil beasts, or evil beast-tamers. Amongst such would I not build my

tabernacle.
