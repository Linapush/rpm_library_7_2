called Zarathustra.



I am Zarathustra who once said: ‘What doth it now matter about kings!’

Forgive me; I rejoiced when ye said to each other: ‘What doth it matter

about us kings!’



Here, however, is MY domain and jurisdiction: what may ye be seeking in

my domain? Perhaps, however, ye have FOUND on your way what _I_ seek:

namely, the higher man.”



When the kings heard this, they beat upon their breasts and said with

one voice: “We are recognised!



With the sword of thine utterance severest thou the thickest darkness of

our hearts. Thou hast discovered our distress; for lo! we are on our way

to find the higher man—



—The man that is higher than we, although we are kings. To him do we

convey this ass. For the highest man shall also be the highest lord on

earth.



There is no sorer misfortune in all human destiny, than when the mighty

of the earth are not also the first men. Then everything becometh false

and distorted and monstrous.



And when they are even the last men, and more beast than man, then

riseth and riseth the populace in honour, and at last saith even the

populace-virtue: ‘Lo, I alone am virtue!’”—



What have I just heard? answered Zarathustra. What wisdom in kings! I

am enchanted, and verily, I have already promptings to make a rhyme

thereon:—



—Even if it should happen to be a rhyme not suited for every one’s

ears. I unlearned long ago to have consideration for long ears. Well

then! Well now!



(Here, however, it happened that the ass also found utterance: it said

distinctly and with malevolence, Y-E-A.)
