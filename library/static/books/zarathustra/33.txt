Fellow-creators, Zarathustra seeketh; fellow-reapers and

fellow-rejoicers, Zarathustra seeketh: what hath he to do with herds and

herdsmen and corpses!



And thou, my first companion, rest in peace! Well have I buried thee in

thy hollow tree; well have I hid thee from the wolves.



But I part from thee; the time hath arrived. ‘Twixt rosy dawn and rosy

dawn there came unto me a new truth.



I am not to be a herdsman, I am not to be a grave-digger. Not any more

will I discourse unto the people; for the last time have I spoken unto

the dead.



With the creators, the reapers, and the rejoicers will I associate: the

rainbow will I show them, and all the stairs to the Superman.



To the lone-dwellers will I sing my song, and to the twain-dwellers;

and unto him who hath still ears for the unheard, will I make the heart

heavy with my happiness.



I make for my goal, I follow my course; over the loitering and tardy

will I leap. Thus let my on-going be their down-going!



10.



This had Zarathustra said to his heart when the sun stood at noontide.

Then he looked inquiringly aloft,—for he heard above him the sharp call

of a bird. And behold! An eagle swept through the air in wide circles,

and on it hung a serpent, not like a prey, but like a friend: for it

kept itself coiled round the eagle’s neck.



“They are mine animals,” said Zarathustra, and rejoiced in his heart.



“The proudest animal under the sun, and the wisest animal under the

sun,—they have come out to reconnoitre.



They want to know whether Zarathustra still liveth. Verily, do I still

live?
