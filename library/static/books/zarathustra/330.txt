     The lonesomest leg?

     In fear perhaps before a

     Furious, yellow, blond and curled

     Leonine monster?  Or perhaps even

     Gnawed away, nibbled badly—

     Most wretched, woeful! woeful! nibbled badly!  Selah.



     Oh, weep ye not,

     Gentle spirits!

     Weep ye not, ye

     Date-fruit spirits!  Milk-bosoms!

     Ye sweetwood-heart

     Purselets!

     Weep ye no more,

     Pallid Dudu!

     Be a man, Suleika!  Bold!  Bold!

     —Or else should there perhaps

     Something strengthening, heart-strengthening,

     Here most proper be?

     Some inspiring text?

     Some solemn exhortation?—

     Ha!  Up now! honour!

     Moral honour!  European honour!

     Blow again, continue,

     Bellows-box of virtue!

     Ha!

     Once more thy roaring,

     Thy moral roaring!

     As a virtuous lion

     Nigh the daughters of deserts roaring!

     —For virtue’s out-howl,

     Ye very dearest maidens,

     Is more than every

     European fervour, European hot-hunger!

     And now do I stand here,

     As European,

     I can’t be different, God’s help to me!

     Amen!



THE DESERTS GROW: WOE HIM WHO DOTH THEM HIDE!
