For this is the truth: I have departed from the house of the scholars,

and the door have I also slammed behind me.



Too long did my soul sit hungry at their table: not like them have I got

the knack of investigating, as the knack of nut-cracking.



Freedom do I love, and the air over fresh soil; rather would I sleep on

unto them!—they know well how to grind corn small, and make white dust
