same mistaken tactics on the part of most publishers, all proceed in the

same happy-go-lucky style when “taking him up.” They have had it said to

them that he wrote without any system, and they very naturally conclude

that it does not matter in the least whether they begin with his first,

third, or last book, provided they can obtain a few vague ideas as to

what his leading and most sensational principles were.



Now, it is clear that the book with the most mysterious, startling, or

suggestive title, will always stand the best chance of being purchased

by those who have no other criteria to guide them in their choice

than the aspect of a title-page; and this explains why “Thus Spake

Zarathustra” is almost always the first and often the only one of

Nietzsche’s books that falls into the hands of the uninitiated.



The title suggests all kinds of mysteries; a glance at the

chapter-headings quickly confirms the suspicions already aroused,

and the sub-title: “A Book for All and None”, generally succeeds in

dissipating the last doubts the prospective purchaser may entertain

concerning his fitness for the book or its fitness for him. And what

happens?



“Thus Spake Zarathustra” is taken home; the reader, who perchance may

know no more concerning Nietzsche than a magazine article has told him,

tries to read it and, understanding less than half he reads, probably

never gets further than the second or third part,—and then only to feel

convinced that Nietzsche himself was “rather hazy” as to what he was

talking about. Such chapters as “The Child with the Mirror”, “In the

Happy Isles”, “The Grave-Song,” “Immaculate Perception,” “The Stillest

Hour”, “The Seven Seals”, and many others, are almost utterly devoid of

meaning to all those who do not know something of Nietzsche’s life, his

aims and his friendships.



As a matter of fact, “Thus Spake Zarathustra”, though it is

unquestionably Nietzsche’s opus magnum, is by no means the first of

Nietzsche’s works that the beginner ought to undertake to read. The

author himself refers to it as the deepest work ever offered to the

German public, and elsewhere speaks of his other writings as being

necessary for the understanding of it. But when it is remembered that

in Zarathustra we not only have the history of his most intimate

experiences, friendships, feuds, disappointments, triumphs and the like,
