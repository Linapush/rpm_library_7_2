alarm of the spirit. And he who is not a bird should not camp above

abysses.



Ye seem to me lukewarm ones: but coldly floweth all deep knowledge.

Ice-cold are the innermost wells of the spirit: a refreshment to hot

hands and handlers.



Respectable do ye there stand, and stiff, and with straight backs, ye

famous wise ones!—no strong wind or will impelleth you.



Have ye ne’er seen a sail crossing the sea, rounded and inflated, and

trembling with the violence of the wind?



Like the sail trembling with the violence of the spirit, doth my wisdom

cross the sea—my wild wisdom!



But ye servants of the people, ye famous wise ones—how COULD ye go with

me!—



Thus spake Zarathustra.









XXXI. THE NIGHT-SONG.





‘Tis night: now do all gushing fountains speak louder. And my soul also

is a gushing fountain.



‘Tis night: now only do all songs of the loving ones awake. And my soul

also is the song of a loving one.



Something unappeased, unappeasable, is within me; it longeth to find

expression. A craving for love is within me, which speaketh itself the

language of love.



Light am I: ah, that I were night! But it is my lonesomeness to be

begirt with light!
