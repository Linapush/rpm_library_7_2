That they may not quarrel with one another, the good females! And about

thee, thou unhappy one!



Peace with God and thy neighbour: so desireth good sleep. And peace also

with thy neighbour’s devil! Otherwise it will haunt thee in the night.



Honour to the government, and obedience, and also to the crooked

government! So desireth good sleep. How can I help it, if power like to

walk on crooked legs?



He who leadeth his sheep to the greenest pasture, shall always be for me

the best shepherd: so doth it accord with good sleep.



Many honours I want not, nor great treasures: they excite the spleen.

But it is bad sleeping without a good name and a little treasure.



A small company is more welcome to me than a bad one: but they must come

and go at the right time. So doth it accord with good sleep.



Well, also, do the poor in spirit please me: they promote sleep. Blessed

are they, especially if one always give in to them.



Thus passeth the day unto the virtuous. When night cometh, then take I

good care not to summon sleep. It disliketh to be summoned—sleep, the

lord of the virtues!



But I think of what I have done and thought during the day. Thus

ruminating, patient as a cow, I ask myself: What were thy ten

overcomings?



And what were the ten reconciliations, and the ten truths, and the ten

laughters with which my heart enjoyed itself?



Thus pondering, and cradled by forty thoughts, it overtaketh me all at

once—sleep, the unsummoned, the lord of the virtues.



Sleep tappeth on mine eye, and it turneth heavy. Sleep toucheth my

mouth, and it remaineth open.
