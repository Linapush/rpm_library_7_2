Did he himself find no cause for laughter on the earth? Then he sought

badly. A child even findeth cause for it.



He—did not love sufficiently: otherwise would he also have loved

us, the laughing ones! But he hated and hooted us; wailing and

teeth-gnashing did he promise us.



Must one then curse immediately, when one doth not love? That—seemeth

to me bad taste. Thus did he, however, this absolute one. He sprang from

the populace.



And he himself just did not love sufficiently; otherwise would he have

raged less because people did not love him. All great love doth not SEEK

love:—it seeketh more.



Go out of the way of all such absolute ones! They are a poor sickly

type, a populace-type: they look at this life with ill-will, they have

an evil eye for this earth.



Go out of the way of all such absolute ones! They have heavy feet and

sultry hearts:—they do not know how to dance. How could the earth be

light to such ones!



17.



Tortuously do all good things come nigh to their goal. Like cats

they curve their backs, they purr inwardly with their approaching

happiness,—all good things laugh.



His step betrayeth whether a person already walketh on HIS OWN path:

just see me walk! He, however, who cometh nigh to his goal, danceth.



And verily, a statue have I not become, not yet do I stand there stiff,

stupid and stony, like a pillar; I love fast racing.



And though there be on earth fens and dense afflictions, he who hath

light feet runneth even across the mud, and danceth, as upon well-swept

ice.
