—Shatter, shatter, O my brethren, those old tables of the pious! Tatter

the maxims of the world-maligners!—



16.



“He who learneth much unlearneth all violent cravings”—that do people

now whisper to one another in all the dark lanes.



“Wisdom wearieth, nothing is worth while; thou shalt not crave!”—this

new table found I hanging even in the public markets.



Break up for me, O my brethren, break up also that NEW table! The

weary-o’-the-world put it up, and the preachers of death and the jailer:

for lo, it is also a sermon for slavery:—



Because they learned badly and not the best, and everything too early

and everything too fast; because they ATE badly: from thence hath

resulted their ruined stomach;—



—For a ruined stomach, is their spirit: IT persuadeth to death! For

verily, my brethren, the spirit IS a stomach!



Life is a well of delight, but to him in whom the ruined stomach

speaketh, the father of affliction, all fountains are poisoned.



To discern: that is DELIGHT to the lion-willed! But he who hath become

weary, is himself merely “willed”; with him play all the waves.



And such is always the nature of weak men: they lose themselves on their

way. And at last asketh their weariness: “Why did we ever go on the way?

All is indifferent!”



TO THEM soundeth it pleasant to have preached in their ears: “Nothing is

worth while! Ye shall not will!” That, however, is a sermon for slavery.



O my brethren, a fresh blustering wind cometh Zarathustra unto all

way-weary ones; many noses will he yet make sneeze!



Even through walls bloweth my free breath, and in into prisons and

imprisoned spirits!
