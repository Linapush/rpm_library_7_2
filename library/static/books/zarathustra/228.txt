O my brethren, there are tables which weariness framed, and tables

which slothfulness framed, corrupt slothfulness: although they speak

similarly, they want to be heard differently.—



See this languishing one! Only a span-breadth is he from his goal; but

from weariness hath he lain down obstinately in the dust, this brave

one!



From weariness yawneth he at the path, at the earth, at the goal, and at

himself: not a step further will he go,—this brave one!



Now gloweth the sun upon him, and the dogs lick at his sweat: but he

lieth there in his obstinacy and preferreth to languish:—



—A span-breadth from his goal, to languish! Verily, ye will have to

drag him into his heaven by the hair of his head—this hero!



Better still that ye let him lie where he hath lain down, that sleep may

come unto him, the comforter, with cooling patter-rain.



Let him lie, until of his own accord he awakeneth,—until of his own

accord he repudiateth all weariness, and what weariness hath taught

through him!



Only, my brethren, see that ye scare the dogs away from him, the idle

skulkers, and all the swarming vermin:—



—All the swarming vermin of the “cultured,” that—feast on the sweat of

every hero!—

I form circles around me and holy boundaries; ever fewer ascend with

me ever higher mountains: I build a mountain-range out of ever holier

mountains.—
