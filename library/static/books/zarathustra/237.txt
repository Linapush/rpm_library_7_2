up from his couch like a madman, crying with a frightful voice, and

acting as if some one still lay on the couch who did not wish to rise.

Zarathustra’s voice also resounded in such a manner that his animals

came to him frightened, and out of all the neighbouring caves and

lurking-places all the creatures slipped away—flying, fluttering,

creeping or leaping, according to their variety of foot or wing.

Zarathustra, however, spake these words:



Up, abysmal thought out of my depth! I am thy cock and morning dawn,

thou overslept reptile: Up! Up! My voice shall soon crow thee awake!



Unbind the fetters of thine ears: listen! For I wish to hear thee! Up!

Up! There is thunder enough to make the very graves listen!



And rub the sleep and all the dimness and blindness out of thine eyes!

Hear me also with thine eyes: my voice is a medicine even for those born

blind.



And once thou art awake, then shalt thou ever remain awake. It is not

MY custom to awake great-grandmothers out of their sleep that I may bid

them—sleep on!



Thou stirrest, stretchest thyself, wheezest? Up! Up! Not wheeze, shalt

thou,—but speak unto me! Zarathustra calleth thee, Zarathustra the

godless!



I, Zarathustra, the advocate of living, the advocate of suffering, the

advocate of the circuit—thee do I call, my most abysmal thought!



Joy to me! Thou comest,—I hear thee! Mine abyss SPEAKETH, my lowest

depth have I turned over into the light!



Joy to me! Come hither! Give me thy hand—ha! let be! aha!—Disgust,

disgust, disgust—alas to me!

Hardly, however, had Zarathustra spoken these words, when he fell down

as one dead, and remained long as one dead. When however he again came

to himself, then was he pale and trembling, and remained lying; and for
