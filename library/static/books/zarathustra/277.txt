—And here there arose a long silence between them: Zarathustra,

however, became profoundly absorbed in thought, so that he shut his

eyes. But afterwards coming back to the situation, he grasped the hand

of the magician, and said, full of politeness and policy:



“Well! Up thither leadeth the way, there is the cave of Zarathustra. In

it mayest thou seek him whom thou wouldst fain find.



And ask counsel of mine animals, mine eagle and my serpent: they shall

help thee to seek. My cave however is large.



I myself, to be sure—I have as yet seen no great man. That which is

great, the acutest eye is at present insensible to it. It is the kingdom

of the populace.



Many a one have I found who stretched and inflated himself, and the

people cried: ‘Behold; a great man!’ But what good do all bellows do!

The wind cometh out at last.



At last bursteth the frog which hath inflated itself too long: then

cometh out the wind. To prick a swollen one in the belly, I call good

pastime. Hear that, ye boys!



Our to-day is of the populace: who still KNOWETH what is great and what

is small! Who could there seek successfully for greatness! A fool only:

it succeedeth with fools.



Thou seekest for great men, thou strange fool? Who TAUGHT that to thee?

Is to-day the time for it? Oh, thou bad seeker, why dost thou—tempt

me?”—



Thus spake Zarathustra, comforted in his heart, and went laughing on his

way.
