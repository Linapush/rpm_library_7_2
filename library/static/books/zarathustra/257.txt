When Zarathustra, however, was aloft on the summit, he sent his animals

home that had accompanied him, and found that he was now alone:—then he

laughed from the bottom of his heart, looked around him, and spake thus:



That I spake of sacrifices and honey-sacrifices, it was merely a ruse

in talking and verily, a useful folly! Here aloft can I now speak freer
