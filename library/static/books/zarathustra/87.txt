Verily, too early died that Hebrew whom the preachers of slow death

honour: and to many hath it proved a calamity that he died too early.



As yet had he known only tears, and the melancholy of the Hebrews,

together with the hatred of the good and just—the Hebrew Jesus: then

was he seized with the longing for death.



Had he but remained in the wilderness, and far from the good and just!

Then, perhaps, would he have learned to live, and love the earth—and

laughter also!



Believe it, my brethren! He died too early; he himself would have

disavowed his doctrine had he attained to my age! Noble enough was he to

disavow!



But he was still immature. Immaturely loveth the youth, and immaturely

also hateth he man and earth. Confined and awkward are still his soul

and the wings of his spirit.



But in man there is more of the child than in the youth, and less of

melancholy: better understandeth he about life and death.



Free for death, and free in death; a holy Naysayer, when there is no

longer time for Yea: thus understandeth he about death and life.



That your dying may not be a reproach to man and the earth, my friends:

that do I solicit from the honey of your soul.



In your dying shall your spirit and your virtue still shine like an

evening after-glow around the earth: otherwise your dying hath been

unsatisfactory.



Thus will I die myself, that ye friends may love the earth more for my

sake; and earth will I again become, to have rest in her that bore me.



Verily, a goal had Zarathustra; he threw his ball. Now be ye friends the

heirs of my goal; to you throw I the golden ball.



Best of all, do I see you, my friends, throw the golden ball! And so

tarry I still a little while on the earth—pardon me for it!
