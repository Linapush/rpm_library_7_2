Of late did I gaze into thine eye, O Life! And into the unfathomable did

I there seem to sink.



But thou pulledst me out with a golden angle; derisively didst thou

laugh when I called thee unfathomable.



“Such is the language of all fish,” saidst thou; “what THEY do not

fathom is unfathomable.



But changeable am I only, and wild, and altogether a woman, and no

virtuous one:



Though I be called by you men the ‘profound one,’ or the ‘faithful one,’

‘the eternal one,’ ‘the mysterious one.’



But ye men endow us always with your own virtues—alas, ye virtuous

ones!”



Thus did she laugh, the unbelievable one; but never do I believe her and

her laughter, when she speaketh evil of herself.



And when I talked face to face with my wild Wisdom, she said to me

angrily: “Thou willest, thou cravest, thou lovest; on that account alone

dost thou PRAISE Life!”



Then had I almost answered indignantly and told the truth to the angry

one; and one cannot answer more indignantly than when one “telleth the

truth” to one’s Wisdom.



For thus do things stand with us three. In my heart do I love only

Life—and verily, most when I hate her!



But that I am fond of Wisdom, and often too fond, is because she

remindeth me very strongly of Life!



She hath her eye, her laugh, and even her golden angle-rod: am I

responsible for it that both are so alike?



And when once Life asked me: “Who is she then, this Wisdom?”—then said

I eagerly: “Ah, yes! Wisdom!
