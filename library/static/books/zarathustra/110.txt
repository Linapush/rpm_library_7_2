the fire.



Mawkish and over-mellow becometh the fruit in their hands: unsteady, and

withered at the top, doth their look make the fruit-tree.



And many a one who hath turned away from life, hath only turned away

from the rabble: he hated to share with them fountain, flame, and fruit.



And many a one who hath gone into the wilderness and suffered thirst

with beasts of prey, disliked only to sit at the cistern with filthy

camel-drivers.



And many a one who hath come along as a destroyer, and as a hailstorm

to all cornfields, wanted merely to put his foot into the jaws of the

rabble, and thus stop their throat.



And it is not the mouthful which hath most choked me, to know that life

itself requireth enmity and death and torture-crosses:—



But I asked once, and suffocated almost with my question: What? is the

rabble also NECESSARY for life?



Are poisoned fountains necessary, and stinking fires, and filthy dreams,

and maggots in the bread of life?



Not my hatred, but my loathing, gnawed hungrily at my life! Ah, ofttimes

became I weary of spirit, when I found even the rabble spiritual!



And on the rulers turned I my back, when I saw what they now call

ruling: to traffic and bargain for power—with the rabble!



Amongst peoples of a strange language did I dwell, with stopped ears: so

that the language of their trafficking might remain strange unto me, and

their bargaining for power.



And holding my nose, I went morosely through all yesterdays and to-days:

verily, badly smell all yesterdays and to-days of the scribbling rabble!



Like a cripple become deaf, and blind, and dumb—thus have I lived long;

that I might not live with the power-rabble, the scribe-rabble, and the
