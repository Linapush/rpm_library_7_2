out of it.



They keep a sharp eye on one another, and do not trust each other the

best. Ingenious in little artifices, they wait for those whose knowledge

walketh on lame feet,—like spiders do they wait.



I saw them always prepare their poison with precaution; and always did

they put glass gloves on their fingers in doing so.



They also know how to play with false dice; and so eagerly did I find

them playing, that they perspired thereby.



We are alien to each other, and their virtues are even more repugnant to

my taste than their falsehoods and false dice.



And when I lived with them, then did I live above them. Therefore did

they take a dislike to me.



They want to hear nothing of any one walking above their heads; and so

they put wood and earth and rubbish betwixt me and their heads.



Thus did they deafen the sound of my tread: and least have I hitherto

been heard by the most learned.



All mankind’s faults and weaknesses did they put betwixt themselves and

me:—they call it “false ceiling” in their houses.



But nevertheless I walk with my thoughts ABOVE their heads; and even

should I walk on mine own errors, still would I be above them and their

heads.



For men are NOT equal: so speaketh justice. And what I will, THEY may

not will!—



Thus spake Zarathustra.
