     Down nightwards, faded, downsunken:—



     Thus had I sunken one day

     From mine own truth-insanity,

     From mine own fervid day-longings,

     Of day aweary, sick of sunshine,

     —Sunk downwards, evenwards, shadowwards:

     By one sole trueness

     All scorched and thirsty:

     —Bethinkst thou still, bethinkst thou, burning heart,

     How then thou thirstedest?—

     THAT I SHOULD BANNED BE

     FROM ALL THE TRUENESS!

     MERE FOOL!  MERE POET!

Thus sang the magician; and all who were present went like birds

unawares into the net of his artful and melancholy voluptuousness.

Only the spiritually conscientious one had not been caught: he at once

snatched the harp from the magician and called out: “Air! Let in good

air! Let in Zarathustra! Thou makest this cave sultry and poisonous,

thou bad old magician!



Thou seducest, thou false one, thou subtle one, to unknown desires and

deserts. And alas, that such as thou should talk and make ado about the

TRUTH!



Alas, to all free spirits who are not on their guard against SUCH

magicians! It is all over with their freedom: thou teachest and temptest

back into prisons,—



—Thou old melancholy devil, out of thy lament soundeth a lurement: thou

resemblest those who with their praise of chastity secretly invite to

voluptuousness!”
