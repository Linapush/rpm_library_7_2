have your comforting—and new speckled shells!—



Thus spake Zarathustra.

To everything cleanly am I well disposed; but I hate to see the grinning

mouths and the thirst of the unclean.



They cast their eye down into the fountain: and now glanceth up to me

their odious smile out of the fountain.



The holy water have they poisoned with their lustfulness; and when they

called their filthy dreams delight, then poisoned they also the words.



Indignant becometh the flame when they put their damp hearts to the

fire; the spirit itself bubbleth and smoketh when the rabble approach
