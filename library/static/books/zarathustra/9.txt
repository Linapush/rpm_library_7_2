Superman, who is now put before us with overpowering passion as the

aim of our life, hope, and will. And just as the old system of valuing,

which only extolled the qualities favourable to the weak, the suffering,

and the oppressed, has succeeded in producing a weak, suffering, and

“modern” race, so this new and reversed system of valuing ought to rear

a healthy, strong, lively, and courageous type, which would be a glory

to life itself. Stated briefly, the leading principle of this new system

of valuing would be: “All that proceeds from power is good, all that

springs from weakness is bad.”



This type must not be regarded as a fanciful figure: it is not a

nebulous hope which is to be realised at some indefinitely remote

period, thousands of years hence; nor is it a new species (in the

Darwinian sense) of which we can know nothing, and which it would

therefore be somewhat absurd to strive after. But it is meant to be

a possibility which men of the present could realise with all their

spiritual and physical energies, provided they adopted the new values.



The author of “Zarathustra” never lost sight of that egregious example

of a transvaluation of all values through Christianity, whereby the

whole of the deified mode of life and thought of the Greeks, as well as

strong Romedom, was almost annihilated or transvalued in a comparatively

short time. Could not a rejuvenated Graeco-Roman system of valuing (once

it had been refined and made more profound by the schooling which

two thousand years of Christianity had provided) effect another such

revolution within a calculable period of time, until that glorious type

of manhood shall finally appear which is to be our new faith and hope,

and in the creation of which Zarathustra exhorts us to participate?



In his private notes on the subject the author uses the expression

“Superman” (always in the singular, by-the-bye), as signifying “the most

thoroughly well-constituted type,” as opposed to “modern man”; above

all, however, he designates Zarathustra himself as an example of the

Superman. In “Ecco Homo” he is careful to enlighten us concerning the

precursors and prerequisites to the advent of this highest type, in

referring to a certain passage in the “Gay Science”:—



“In order to understand this type, we must first be quite clear in

regard to the leading physiological condition on which it depends: this

condition is what I call GREAT HEALTHINESS. I know not how to express my
