I love him who maketh his virtue his inclination and destiny: thus, for

the sake of his virtue, he is willing to live on, or live no more.



I love him who desireth not too many virtues. One virtue is more of a

virtue than two, because it is more of a knot for one’s destiny to cling

to.



I love him whose soul is lavish, who wanteth no thanks and doth not give

back: for he always bestoweth, and desireth not to keep for himself.



I love him who is ashamed when the dice fall in his favour, and who then

asketh: “Am I a dishonest player?”—for he is willing to succumb.



I love him who scattereth golden words in advance of his deeds, and

always doeth more than he promiseth: for he seeketh his own down-going.



I love him who justifieth the future ones, and redeemeth the past ones:

for he is willing to succumb through the present ones.



I love him who chasteneth his God, because he loveth his God: for he

must succumb through the wrath of his God.



I love him whose soul is deep even in the wounding, and may succumb

through a small matter: thus goeth he willingly over the bridge.



I love him whose soul is so overfull that he forgetteth himself, and all

things are in him: thus all things become his down-going.



I love him who is of a free spirit and a free heart: thus is his

head only the bowels of his heart; his heart, however, causeth his

down-going.



I love all who are like heavy drops falling one by one out of the dark

cloud that lowereth over man: they herald the coming of the lightning,

and succumb as heralds.



Lo, I am a herald of the lightning, and a heavy drop out of the cloud:

the lightning, however, is the SUPERMAN.—
