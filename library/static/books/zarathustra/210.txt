calleth itself “virtue.”



With its words of good and bad doth such self-enjoyment shelter itself

as with sacred groves; with the names of its happiness doth it banish

from itself everything contemptible.



Away from itself doth it banish everything cowardly; it saith:

“Bad—THAT IS cowardly!” Contemptible seem to it the ever-solicitous,

the sighing, the complaining, and whoever pick up the most trifling

advantage.



It despiseth also all bitter-sweet wisdom: for verily, there is also

wisdom that bloometh in the dark, a night-shade wisdom, which ever

sigheth: “All is vain!”



Shy distrust is regarded by it as base, and every one who wanteth oaths

instead of looks and hands: also all over-distrustful wisdom,—for such

is the mode of cowardly souls.



Baser still it regardeth the obsequious, doggish one, who immediately

lieth on his back, the submissive one; and there is also wisdom that is

submissive, and doggish, and pious, and obsequious.



Hateful to it altogether, and a loathing, is he who will never defend

himself, he who swalloweth down poisonous spittle and bad looks, the

all-too-patient one, the all-endurer, the all-satisfied one: for that is

the mode of slaves.



Whether they be servile before Gods and divine spurnings, or before men

and stupid human opinions: at ALL kinds of slaves doth it spit, this

blessed selfishness!



Bad: thus doth it call all that is spirit-broken, and

sordidly-servile—constrained, blinking eyes, depressed hearts, and the

false submissive style, which kisseth with broad cowardly lips.



And spurious wisdom: so doth it call all the wit that slaves, and

hoary-headed and weary ones affect; and especially all the cunning,

spurious-witted, curious-witted foolishness of priests!
