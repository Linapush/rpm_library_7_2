O my brethren, he who is a firstling is ever sacrificed. Now, however,

are we firstlings!



We all bleed on secret sacrificial altars, we all burn and broil in

honour of ancient idols.



Our best is still young: this exciteth old palates. Our flesh is tender,

our skin is only lambs’ skin:—how could we not excite old idol-priests!



IN OURSELVES dwelleth he still, the old idol-priest, who broileth our

best for his banquet. Ah, my brethren, how could firstlings fail to be

sacrifices!



But so wisheth our type; and I love those who do not wish to preserve

themselves, the down-going ones do I love with mine entire love: for

they go beyond.—

To be true—that CAN few be! And he who can, will not! Least of all,

however, can the good be true.



Oh, those good ones! GOOD MEN NEVER SPEAK THE TRUTH. For the spirit,

thus to be good, is a malady.



They yield, those good ones, they submit themselves; their heart

repeateth, their soul obeyeth: HE, however, who obeyeth, DOTH NOT LISTEN

TO HIMSELF!



All that is called evil by the good, must come together in order that

one truth may be born. O my brethren, are ye also evil enough for THIS

truth?



The daring venture, the prolonged distrust, the cruel Nay, the tedium,

the cutting-into-the-quick—how seldom do THESE come together! Out of

such seed, however—is truth produced!
