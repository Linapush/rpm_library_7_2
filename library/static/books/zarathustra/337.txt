Thou seemest to me transformed, thine eyes glow, the mantle of the

sublime covereth thine ugliness: WHAT didst thou do?



Is it then true what they say, that thou hast again awakened him? And

why? Was he not for good reasons killed and made away with?



Thou thyself seemest to me awakened: what didst thou do? why didst THOU

turn round? Why didst THOU get converted? Speak, thou nondescript!”



“O Zarathustra,” answered the ugliest man, “thou art a rogue!



Whether HE yet liveth, or again liveth, or is thoroughly dead—which of

us both knoweth that best? I ask thee.



One thing however do I know,—from thyself did I learn it once, O

Zarathustra: he who wanteth to kill most thoroughly, LAUGHETH.



‘Not by wrath but by laughter doth one kill’—thus spakest thou once,

O Zarathustra, thou hidden one, thou destroyer without wrath, thou

dangerous saint,—thou art a rogue!”

Then, however, did it come to pass that Zarathustra, astonished at such

merely roguish answers, jumped back to the door of his cave, and turning

towards all his guests, cried out with a strong voice:



“O ye wags, all of you, ye buffoons! Why do ye dissemble and disguise

yourselves before me!



How the hearts of all of you convulsed with delight and wickedness,

because ye had at last become again like little children—namely,

pious,—



—Because ye at last did again as children do—namely, prayed, folded

your hands and said ‘good God’!



But now leave, I pray you, THIS nursery, mine own cave, where to-day

all childishness is carried on. Cool down, here outside, your hot

child-wantonness and heart-tumult!
