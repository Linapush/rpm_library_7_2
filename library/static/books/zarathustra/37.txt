II. THE ACADEMIC CHAIRS OF VIRTUE.





People commended unto Zarathustra a wise man, as one who could discourse

well about sleep and virtue: greatly was he honoured and rewarded for

it, and all the youths sat before his chair. To him went Zarathustra,

and sat among the youths before his chair. And thus spake the wise man:



Respect and modesty in presence of sleep! That is the first thing! And

to go out of the way of all who sleep badly and keep awake at night!



Modest is even the thief in presence of sleep: he always stealeth softly

through the night. Immodest, however, is the night-watchman; immodestly

he carrieth his horn.



No small art is it to sleep: it is necessary for that purpose to keep

awake all day.



Ten times a day must thou overcome thyself: that causeth wholesome

weariness, and is poppy to the soul.



Ten times must thou reconcile again with thyself; for overcoming is

bitterness, and badly sleep the unreconciled.



Ten truths must thou find during the day; otherwise wilt thou seek truth

during the night, and thy soul will have been hungry.



Ten times must thou laugh during the day, and be cheerful; otherwise thy

stomach, the father of affliction, will disturb thee in the night.



Few people know it, but one must have all the virtues in order to sleep

well. Shall I bear false witness? Shall I commit adultery?



Shall I covet my neighbourâ€™s maidservant? All that would ill accord with

good sleep.



And even if one have all the virtues, there is still one thing needful:

to send the virtues themselves to sleep at the right time.
