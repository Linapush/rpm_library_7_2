wretched self-complacency.



I am a railing alongside the torrent; whoever is able to grasp me may

grasp me! Your crutch, however, I am not.—



Thus spake Zarathustra.









VII. READING AND WRITING.





Of all that is written, I love only what a person hath written with his

blood. Write with blood, and thou wilt find that blood is spirit.



It is no easy task to understand unfamiliar blood; I hate the reading

idlers.



He who knoweth the reader, doeth nothing more for the reader. Another

century of readers—and spirit itself will stink.



Every one being allowed to learn to read, ruineth in the long run not

only writing but also thinking.



Once spirit was God, then it became man, and now it even becometh

populace.



He that writeth in blood and proverbs doth not want to be read, but

learnt by heart.



In the mountains the shortest way is from peak to peak, but for that

route thou must have long legs. Proverbs should be peaks, and those

spoken to should be big and tall.



The atmosphere rare and pure, danger near and the spirit full of a

joyful wickedness: thus are things well matched.



I want to have goblins about me, for I am courageous. The courage which

scareth away ghosts, createth for itself goblins—it wanteth to laugh.
