and repeated it!



Verily, ye could wear no better masks, ye present-day men, than your own

faces! Who could—RECOGNISE you!



Written all over with the characters of the past, and these characters

also pencilled over with new characters—thus have ye concealed

yourselves well from all decipherers!



And though one be a trier of the reins, who still believeth that ye have

reins! Out of colours ye seem to be baked, and out of glued scraps.



All times and peoples gaze divers-coloured out of your veils; all

customs and beliefs speak divers-coloured out of your gestures.



He who would strip you of veils and wrappers, and paints and gestures,

would just have enough left to scare the crows.



Verily, I myself am the scared crow that once saw you naked, and without

paint; and I flew away when the skeleton ogled at me.



Rather would I be a day-labourer in the nether-world, and among the

shades of the bygone!—Fatter and fuller than ye, are forsooth the

nether-worldlings!



This, yea this, is bitterness to my bowels, that I can neither endure

you naked nor clothed, ye present-day men!



All that is unhomelike in the future, and whatever maketh strayed birds

shiver, is verily more homelike and familiar than your “reality.”



For thus speak ye: “Real are we wholly, and without faith and

superstition”: thus do ye plume yourselves—alas! even without plumes!



Indeed, how would ye be ABLE to believe, ye divers-coloured ones!—ye

who are pictures of all that hath ever been believed!



Perambulating refutations are ye, of belief itself, and a dislocation of

all thought. UNTRUSTWORTHY ONES: thus do _I_ call you, ye real ones!
