—Until over calm longing seas the bark glideth, the golden marvel,

around the gold of which all good, bad, and marvellous things frisk:—



—Also many large and small animals, and everything that hath light

marvellous feet, so that it can run on violet-blue paths,—



—Towards the golden marvel, the spontaneous bark, and its master: he,

however, is the vintager who waiteth with the diamond vintage-knife,—



—Thy great deliverer, O my soul, the nameless one—for whom future

songs only will find names! And verily, already hath thy breath the

fragrance of future songs,—



—Already glowest thou and dreamest, already drinkest thou thirstily at

all deep echoing wells of consolation, already reposeth thy melancholy

in the bliss of future songs!—



O my soul, now have I given thee all, and even my last possession, and

all my hands have become empty by thee:—THAT I BADE THEE SING, behold,

that was my last thing to give!



That I bade thee sing,—say now, say: WHICH of us now—oweth thanks?—

Better still, however: sing unto me, sing, O my soul! And let me thank

thee!—
