Thou hast mounted, however, on horseback? Thou now ridest briskly up

to thy goal? Well, my friend! But thy lame foot is also with thee on

horseback!



When thou reachest thy goal, when thou alightest from thy horse:

precisely on thy HEIGHT, thou higher man,—then wilt thou stumble!

Ye creating ones, ye higher men! One is only pregnant with one’s own

child.



Do not let yourselves be imposed upon or put upon! Who then is YOUR

neighbour? Even if ye act “for your neighbour”—ye still do not create

for him!



Unlearn, I pray you, this “for,” ye creating ones: your very virtue

wisheth you to have naught to do with “for” and “on account of” and

“because.” Against these false little words shall ye stop your ears.



“For one’s neighbour,” is the virtue only of the petty people: there it

is said “like and like,” and “hand washeth hand”:—they have neither the

right nor the power for YOUR self-seeking!



In your self-seeking, ye creating ones, there is the foresight and

foreseeing of the pregnant! What no one’s eye hath yet seen, namely, the

fruit—this, sheltereth and saveth and nourisheth your entire love.



Where your entire love is, namely, with your child, there is also your

entire virtue! Your work, your will is YOUR “neighbour”: let no false

values impose upon you!



12.



Ye creating ones, ye higher men! Whoever hath to give birth is sick;

whoever hath given birth, however, is unclean.



Ask women: one giveth birth, not because it giveth pleasure. The pain

maketh hens and poets cackle.
