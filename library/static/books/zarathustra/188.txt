Virtue for them is what maketh modest and tame: therewith have they made

the wolf a dog, and man himself man’s best domestic animal.



“We set our chair in the MIDST”—so saith their smirking unto me—“and

as far from dying gladiators as from satisfied swine.”



That, however, is—MEDIOCRITY, though it be called moderation.—

I pass through this people and let fall many words: but they know

neither how to take nor how to retain them.



They wonder why I came not to revile venery and vice; and verily, I came

not to warn against pickpockets either!



They wonder why I am not ready to abet and whet their wisdom: as if they

had not yet enough of wiseacres, whose voices grate on mine ear like

slate-pencils!



And when I call out: “Curse all the cowardly devils in you, that

would fain whimper and fold the hands and adore”—then do they shout:

“Zarathustra is godless.”



And especially do their teachers of submission shout this;—but

precisely in their ears do I love to cry: “Yea! I AM Zarathustra, the

godless!”



Those teachers of submission! Wherever there is aught puny, or sickly,

or scabby, there do they creep like lice; and only my disgust preventeth

me from cracking them.



Well! This is my sermon for THEIR ears: I am Zarathustra the godless,

who saith: “Who is more godless than I, that I may enjoy his teaching?”



I am Zarathustra the godless: where do I find mine equal? And all

those are mine equals who give unto themselves their Will, and divest

themselves of all submission.
