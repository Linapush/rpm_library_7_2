And ‘truth’ is at present what the preacher spake who himself sprang

from them, that singular saint and advocate of the petty people, who

testified of himself: ‘I—am the truth.’



That immodest one hath long made the petty people greatly puffed up,—he

who taught no small error when he taught: ‘I—am the truth.’



Hath an immodest one ever been answered more courteously?—Thou,

however, O Zarathustra, passedst him by, and saidst: ‘Nay! Nay! Three

times Nay!’



Thou warnedst against his error; thou warnedst—the first to do

so—against pity:—not every one, not none, but thyself and thy type.



Thou art ashamed of the shame of the great sufferer; and verily when

thou sayest: ‘From pity there cometh a heavy cloud; take heed, ye men!’



—When thou teachest: ‘All creators are hard, all great love is beyond

their pity:’ O Zarathustra, how well versed dost thou seem to me in

weather-signs!



Thou thyself, however,—warn thyself also against THY pity! For many are

on their way to thee, many suffering, doubting, despairing, drowning,

freezing ones—



I warn thee also against myself. Thou hast read my best, my worst

riddle, myself, and what I have done. I know the axe that felleth thee.



But he—HAD TO die: he looked with eyes which beheld EVERYTHING,—he

beheld men’s depths and dregs, all his hidden ignominy and ugliness.



His pity knew no modesty: he crept into my dirtiest corners. This most

prying, over-intrusive, over-pitiful one had to die.



He ever beheld ME: on such a witness I would have revenge—or not live

myself.



The God who beheld everything, AND ALSO MAN: that God had to die! Man

cannot ENDURE it that such a witness should live.”
