O ye higher men, YOUR distress was it that the old soothsayer foretold

to me yester-morn,—



—Unto your distress did he want to seduce and tempt me: ‘O

Zarathustra,’ said he to me, ‘I come to seduce thee to thy last sin.’



To my last sin?” cried Zarathustra, and laughed angrily at his own

words: “WHAT hath been reserved for me as my last sin?”



—And once more Zarathustra became absorbed in himself, and sat down

again on the big stone and meditated. Suddenly he sprang up,—



“FELLOW-SUFFERING! FELLOW-SUFFERING WITH THE HIGHER MEN!” he cried out,

and his countenance changed into brass. “Well! THAT—hath had its time!



My suffering and my fellow-suffering—what matter about them! Do I then

strive after HAPPINESS? I strive after my WORK!



Well! The lion hath come, my children are nigh, Zarathustra hath grown

ripe, mine hour hath come:—



This is MY morning, MY day beginneth: ARISE NOW, ARISE, THOU GREAT

NOONTIDE!”—



Thus spake Zarathustra and left his cave, glowing and strong, like a

morning sun coming out of gloomy mountains.
