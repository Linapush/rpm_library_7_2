I now go alone, my disciples! Ye also now go away, and alone! So will I

have it.



Verily, I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against

Zarathustra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he hath

deceived you.



The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but also

to hate his friends.



One requiteth a teacher badly if one remain merely a scholar. And why

will ye not pluck at my wreath?



Ye venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day collapse?

Take heed lest a statue crush you!



Ye say, ye believe in Zarathustra? But of what account is Zarathustra!

Ye are my believers: but of what account are all believers!



Ye had not yet sought yourselves: then did ye find me. So do all

believers; therefore all belief is of so little account.



Now do I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when ye have all

denied me, will I return unto you.



Verily, with other eyes, my brethren, shall I then seek my lost ones;

with another love shall I then love you.



And once again shall ye have become friends unto me, and children of one

hope: then will I be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great

noontide with you.



And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course

between animal and Superman, and celebrateth his advance to the evening

as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.



At such time will the down-goer bless himself, that he should be an

over-goer; and the sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.
