Unhappy do I also call those who have ever to WAIT,—they are repugnant

to my taste—all the toll-gatherers and traders, and kings, and other

landkeepers and shopkeepers.



Verily, I learned waiting also, and thoroughly so,—but only waiting for

MYSELF. And above all did I learn standing and walking and running and

leaping and climbing and dancing.



This however is my teaching: he who wisheth one day to fly, must first

learn standing and walking and running and climbing and dancing:—one

doth not fly into flying!



With rope-ladders learned I to reach many a window, with nimble legs did

I climb high masts: to sit on high masts of perception seemed to me no

small bliss;—



—To flicker like small flames on high masts: a small light, certainly,

but a great comfort to cast-away sailors and shipwrecked ones!



By divers ways and wendings did I arrive at my truth; not by one ladder

did I mount to the height where mine eye roveth into my remoteness.



And unwillingly only did I ask my way—that was always counter to my

taste! Rather did I question and test the ways themselves.



A testing and a questioning hath been all my travelling:—and verily,

one must also LEARN to answer such questioning! That, however,—is my

taste:



—Neither a good nor a bad taste, but MY taste, of which I have no

longer either shame or secrecy.



“This—is now MY way,—where is yours?” Thus did I answer those who

asked me “the way.” For THE way—it doth not exist!



Thus spake Zarathustra.
